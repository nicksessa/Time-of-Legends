## Turn 2

Location: Lothian - Lot's Castle
Luck of the Day: 4
The troops Giacomo count as Henchmen and therefore no need to roll is made to keep them.  (perhaps we'll have to see about paying them...)

Still at the castle, Sir Giacomo decides to ask his lord for a dwarf.  He rolls a 2 and either there isn't one or the request is simply denied.

## Turn 3

Location: Lothian - Lot's Castle
Luck of the Day: 5
Request a Dwarf again and got one!
