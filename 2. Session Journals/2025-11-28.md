## Turn 4

Location: [[Lothian]] - Lord Lot's Castle

Luck of the Day: 1

Movement: none

Retainers: No roll needed

[[Prayers and Requests]]: Testing his luck, Giacomo requests a castle of his own from his lord, king [[Lot]]. He rolls a 6 and is granted a castle IF he can complete an [[X. Adventures]] first.

King Lot has given Sir Giacomo the task of making a journey to London - You must deliver an item to London from the person giving you this Adventure. To complete the delivery you must find the item’s recipient (Luck test). This earns 2d6 Virtue Points and 1d6 EXP. If you are robbed, shipwrecked, or otherwise lose the item, the Adventure yields no awards.

Healing: none

## Turn 5

1. [[Luck of the Day]] -> 3
2. Movement and Encounters
	1. Travel from the Castle to the Town.  Buys 1 bandage for each character (cost 60 CP).  No Healing Salves were found on the market.
	2. Roll for encounters: On a 1, 2 or 3 there is an encounter. Rolled: 5 (No Encounter)
3. Comrade and Companion Retention
4. Prayers and Requests
5. Healing

## Turn 6

1. [[Luck of the Day]] -> 5
2. Movement and Encounters
	1. Head to Church for a Blessing: Gain 2d6 DR for one round of combat.
	2. Patron saint. [[List of Saints]]  `dice: [[List of Saints#^saintTable]]`
	3. Roll for encounters: On a 1, 2 or 3 there is an encounter. Rolled: 2.  An [[Encounters#Town Encounters]]!   3 Knights are encountered.  Roll for reaction: [[Reactions#Knight Reactions]]  Give Message - The friendly Knights give a randomly determined Message to the PK (see [[Messages]] table) The Message: Special Tournament at Camelot Castle - All PKs are informed of a Special Tournament at Camelot Castle to be held three turns from now (see page 71). Optional Rule: The SPECIAL TOURNAMENT AT CAMELOT can only occur once per game.
3. Comrade and Companion Retention
4. Prayers and Requests
5. Healing

Giacomo is now faced with a dilemma.  Go to the Tournament or Deliver the item from his Lord to London.  Can he do both?  Given how far away London is, Giacomo decides it would probably be best to travel by boat.

## Turn 7

Turns till Tournament: `3`

1. [[Luck of the Day]]  `dice: 1d6`  `2`
2. Movement and Encounters
	1. Move from Town into the Wilderness.
	2. [[Encounters#Countryside and Wasteland Encounters]] Rolled a 2 for the encounter check which resulted in 1 Knight. Since we're in a hurry, Giacomo decides to avoid the knight.  Rolling a 2, he just barely avoids this encounter.  
	3. He can keep moving but upon reaching the Almond River, must roll for encounters there.  River encounters only occur on a 1 and he rolled a 2, so can move up into Scotland.  This ends his movement for the turn.
3. Comrade and Companion Retention
4. Prayers and Requests
5. Healing


Every 7 days (turns), Optional Fief and Warband rolls.

[[Weather]]
Apparently Berwyn has met a girl and therefore can automatically rally once in the next battle.
Mercenaries have set up shop in Lothian but have not picked sides... yet.


## Turn 8

Turns till Tournament: `2`

1. [[Luck of the Day]] `dice: 1d6`  `2`
2. Movement and Encounters
	1. Move from the Scot countryside to the port city of St. Andrews and check for [[Encounters#Town Encounters]].  Roll a d6 to see if there are any encounters on a 1-3.  Rolled a 2.  We're in a hurry, so we'll spend a Fate Point and re-roll.  Rolled a 2 again... damn.  Check the chart and we have encountered  Beggars - Beggars are simply a nuisance Town encounter, stopping the PK’s movement for that turn. They have no rolled reaction and cannot attack or defend; always friendly, they merely get in the way while telling the PK of their troubles and asking for alms.  If you give them `dice: 2d6` CP, then gain `dice: 1d3` Divine Favor.  Giacomo gained 1 DF and 1 VP by donating 7 CP.
	2. No further movement and the turn is over.
3. Comrade and Companion Retention

5. Healing

## Turn 9

Turns till Tournament: `1`

1. [[Luck of the Day]]   `1`
2. Movement and Encounters
	1. Board ship and head out into the Firth of Forth.  [[Encounters#Sea Encounters]]. Storm: Move Back - A Storm returns the ship to the area it was in at the start of the turn, which could be back to its Port of departure.
	2. Leave port again for the Firth of Forth but we found a Lady Stowaway - A randomly drawn Lady is revealed and her reaction determined normally. If she calls her champion to defend her, he is disguised as a sailor. Her Homeland should be determined randomly if necessary.  The enchantress [[Lady Lynet]] is aboard with 1 admiring knight.  Enchantresses do not roll for reactions.  Instead they always attempt to [[Enchantements]].   She opts to Seduce - The PK is seduced, loses VP equal to the VL of the Enchantress, and enters into the service of the Enchantress. If the PK is already serving a Lady, the PK will lose 1d3 VP for abandoning her (1d6 VP if under Summons), as well as the Service Award. The Enchantress’s Service Award is gained. Enchantress service is a stronger Enchantment that Prayer cannot lift. If a Druid chooses this reaction, he leads the PK to a cottage in the countryside where a randomly drawn Lady rests. The Druid uses his magic to seduce the PK with the innocent Lady (or not-so-innocent Enchantress). No Lady reaction needs to be rolled.  Giacomo fails his VL roll and is seduced by the Enchantress.  He gains 5 Fate Points and +2 to Toughness however.

## An Encounter

| Name |VL | I | ATT | STR | DEF | DR  | AIM | COU | DIS | A | Wounds|
|:--- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---: |

|Name|INI|ATT|STR|DEF|DR|AIM|COU|DIS|A|Wounds|
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Sir Giacomo | 2 | 2 | 4/16 | 3 | 7/8 | 0 | 3 | 4 | 1 |`INPUT[inlineSelect(option(None), option(Shock), option(Light), option(Serious), option(Critical), option(Dead))]`   |


Giacomo and Ulfius decide that this boat just isn't big enough for the two of them, especially since they both are vying for the hand of [[Lady Lynet]].

Roll for Initiative
[[Giacomo]]: 5 + 2 = 7
Ulfius: 6 + 3 = 9

### Round 1
1. Ulfius Attacks: 1 + 3 = Fail 
2. Giacomo Defends: 5 + 3 = 8.  Since Attacker rolled a 1, he's hit. `dice: 1d66%`  STR 4 + 4 = 8   minus DR 6 = 2.  Wound Table 2 on the 2 (Leg) = Stun
3. Giacomo Attacks: 4+2 = 6
4. Ulfius Defends: 6+2=7

### Round 2

1. Ulfius Attacks: 6+4+3
2. Giacomo Defends: Fails - Wound: `dice: 2d6`  STR 6 + 4 = 10 minus DR 8  results in 2 to the leg = Shock
3. Giacomo Attacks: 6 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 16
4. Ulfius Defends: 3 + 3 = 6.  Fails.  Attack Doubles DEF so two wound rolls.  1st Wound Roll: 6, 5 = 10 - 6 = 4 to the location 5 (Head) = Serious Wound.  Second Wound Roll: 6 to the 2 = Light Wound.  Bumps Ulfius up to Critical.

Ulfius checks morale.  He needs to roll a 4+ to continue the fight.  He rolls a 1 and surrenders.
Giacomo gets a chance to level up because this was (potentially) a tough fight.  He rolls a d10 and gets an 8.  Given that a LV 1 character needs to roll a 1 or better, this roll is automatic.

Sir Ulfius was a Knight Banneret (rolled it randomly) and fetched a ransom of 200 SP.
