### MONASTERY CATACOMBS

High in the Grey Mountains stands the remote monastery of La Maisontaal. The monks here are a peaceful lot, living a tranquil if hard-working life of prayer and contemplation. Like most monasteries, La Maisontaal has its own set of catacombs, cut out of the bedrock beneath the monastery buildings, where the monks are buried when they die. Some parts of the catacombs have been sealed for centuries – who can say what might be down there?

### **Quests**

Roll once on the following table to discover why the Heroes are going into the catacombs of La Maisontaal:


| D12   | Quest                   |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| 1-3   | Find the Staff!         |
| 4-6   | Close the Gate          |
| 7-9   | The Lichemaster Returns |
| 10-12 | The Black Box           | 


### **Find the Staff!**

#### **Players’ Information**

Several years ago, a man called Heinrich Kemmler came to La Maisontaal. He claimed to be no more than a traveler in need of shelter, but Rene de Muscadet, the Master of the monastery, recognized him as a notorious Necromancer. In the terrible duel of magic that followed, Kemmler was put to flight, his magical power drained by a magical weapon de Muscadet used – the Staff of Ether Shrivening. Now, Kemmler has returned – a powerful Liche serving the dread forces of Chaos. He intends to destroy the monastery of his old enemy, and the only way to save La Maisontaal is if you can go into the catacombs, find the tomb of Rene de Muscadet, and recover the Staff of Ether Shrivening.

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

Quest rooms will always be stairs down. Each time the Heroes find a sarcophagus, you should roll a D12 – a roll of 12 or more means that they have found the tomb of de Muscadet. Add 1 for each sarcophagus they have already discovered, and 1 for each Fate Point they spend to increase their chances. Players must decide to spend Fate Points before the dice is rolled. The sarcophagus may not be searched – it contains only the staff and the body of de Muscadet. The Quest is completed if one or more Heroes leave the complex with the staff. The Heroes may use the staff on their way out, although they may not keep it after the Quest.

The staff counts as a spear for damage and fumbles, and can attack diagonally adjacent squares. Each time it hits a creature which can cast spells, it destroys one spell in addition to normal damage; the spell may no longer be cast until the creature learns it all over again, as every trace of it has been wiped from the creature’s mind. If the creature has more than one spell, choose one at random. A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so.

### **Close the Gate**

#### **Players’ Information**

Heinrich Kemmler has returned to La Maisontaal at the head of a vast undead army. A terrible battle is taking place on the ground, and an ancient chronicle tells of another way in – a secret passage through the catacombs. You must seal that entrance before the undead find it – but they may have found it already, so be wary. Your wizard has a scroll which will seal the entrance, but only he can cast the spell which is inscribed on it.

Take a Liche Character Monster Counter to represent Heinrich Kemmler. The first and second Quest rooms encountered will both be stairs down to a deeper level; the third will be the chamber where the undead have found a way in. It contains the Liche (if not previously destroyed) and additional forces generated by two rolls on the _Liche Followers_ table.

To complete the Quest, the Heroes must spend one full exploration turn in here as their Wizard reads the spell on the scroll, which will seal the secret door with solid rock. If their Wizard is killed before they can reach this room, the Quest has failed. A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so.

### **The Lichemaster Returns**

#### **Players’ Information**

Heinrich Kemmler – the dreaded Lichemaster – has returned to La Maisontaal and has established a base in the monastery’s catacombs. All the time his power is building, and soon his undead hordes will pour up from the depths and destroy the monastery, killing everyone they find. Before that time comes, you must go into the catacombs, fight your way through the undead guards, find Heinrich Kemmler, and destroy him.

Take a Liche Character Monster Counter to represent Heinrich Kemmler. The first two Quest rooms encountered will actually be sets of stairs down. The third will be Kemmler’s stronghold – he will be here (if not previously destroyed) along with two rolls of minions from the _Liche Followers_ table. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must meet and destroy Heinrich Kemmler. A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so.

### **The Black Box**

#### **Players’ Information**

There is a great treasure, sacred to the followers of Chaos, which is known as the Arca Chaotis. Once, several years ago, this artefact came to La Maisontaal, and was extensively studied by the late Master of the monastery, Rene de Muscadet. Now, reports have come from the south that the Arca is once more in the hands of the Skaven. Since de Muscadet was one of the few men to study the device, the Emperor has sent you to La Maisontaal to recover his notes – they could be invaluable in defeating the Ratmen. But where are the notes? None of the monks knows anything about them – but one of the older brethren remembers that de Muscadet was given to sneaking down into the catacombs for long periods, and suspects that he has a hidden workroom among the tombs.

Add 1 for each secret door they have already discovered, and 1 for each Fate Point they spend to increase their chances. Players must decide to spend Fate Points before the dice is rolled. A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so.

# **SANCTUARY OF MORR**

In the fantasy world of **Advanced Heroquest,** Morr is the guardian of the dead. He guides them safely into the afterlife, and makes sure that their spirits do not return to trouble the living. The huge burial-complex of Morr’s Town is one of his holy places. People come from all over the world to pay their respects here, and the most faithful of Morr’s followers may earn the privilege of being buried in the catacombs beneath the shrine.

### **Quests**

Roll once on the following table to discover why the Heroes are going into Morr’s Town:


| D12   | Quest               |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| 1-3   | The Raven’s Eye     |
| 4-6   | Forbidden Knowledge |
| 7-9   | Peace at Last       |
| 10-12 | Ghoul Hunt          | 


### **The Raven’s Eye**

#### **Players’ Information**

Deep in the heart of Morr’s Town is a huge shrine, which contains a man-size black iron statue of a raven, Morr’s chosen bird. The eyes of this raven are cut rubies the size of a man’s fist. As well as being immensely valuable, these stones are magical, and provide the power for a series of enchantments which keep undead and other evil creatures out of the catacombs and ensure that the dead rest peacefully there. Now, however, one of the stones is cracked, and the enchantments are threatened. Your Quest is to take a replacement stone into the shrine and fit it into the statue so that the dead of Morr’s Town may continue to be protected. In return, you may keep the stone you take from the statue. It may be cracked, but it’s still a ruby the size of your fist.

The first and second Quest rooms encountered will both be stairs down to a deeper level; the third will be the Raven Shrine. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must spend one full exploration turn in the Raven Shrine replacing the cracked gem. There must be a Wizard with them, for only he has the skills to perform this delicate magical operation. The cracked gem is worth 400 GCs. A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so.

### **Forbidden Knowledge**

#### **Players’ Information**

Deep in the heart of Morr’s Town are many secret hiding-places. It is here that the authorities of the temple of Morr hide things that they cannot destroy – things which have been confiscated from arrested Necromancers and their like, which must be kept away from others to prevent their evil from spreading. A Necromancer named Gotthardt von Wittgenstein has heard about these hiding-places, and has gone into Morr’s Town to try to find them. There are things in Morr’s Town that could make him terrifyingly powerful – you must follow him and stop him.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Wandering Monsters:** _Undead Wandering Monsters_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Undead Wandering Monsters_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Necromancer Followers_ table

Each time the Heroes encounter a Quest room, roll a D12. On a roll of 1-9 it is actually a Hazard room, and the GM may take one Dungeon Counter – time is getting shorter, and Wittgenstein’s undead minions are growing more numerous! On a roll of 10-12, the Heroes have found Wittgenstein’s  lair – he is here (unless he has previously been encountered and killed) with one roll of minions from the _Necromancer Followers_ table.

As time passes, Wittgenstein finds more magical treasures – each time you draw a Dungeon Counter, roll once on the Magic Treasure Table and give the resulting item to Wittgenstein. He can’t use weapons and armour, though, so these are discarded.

To complete the Quest, the Heroes must meet and kill Wittgenstein. They may not keep any of the magical items he has when they find him, but they may keep anything else they find during the Quest. A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so.

### **Peace at Last**

#### **Players’ Information**

An angry spirit is stalking Morr’s Town. The tomb of the priest Brother Hieronymus has been broken into, and his raven pendant – his badge of office – has been stolen. The robbers have been apprehended, but the pendant must be returned before the outraged spirit can rest again.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** see below

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

When a wandering monster is indicated, roll a D12: on a result of 1-6 use the Disturbed Complex table, but on a roll of 7-12 the wandering monster is the angry spirit of Brother Hieronymus – now a Spectre. The Spectre will attack any Hero who is carrying the raven pendant, thinking that this is the robber. If the Spectre is killed during a Wandering Monster encounter, it is not destroyed – it simply flees back to the tomb, only to reappear (restored to full strength) if the Heroes meet it again on another Wandering Monster encounter.

Brother Hieronymus’ tomb is the third Quest room the Heroes find – the first two are sets of stairs leading down. The tomb is a small room with a single sarcophagus in the centre. It has only one door. The Spectre will be here when the Heroes enter, no matter how many times they have previously ‘killed’ it. Again, it will attack the Hero who is carrying the raven pendant. If the Spectre is destroyed in this room, it won’t reappear – however, Brother Hieronymus’ furious spirit will return to its body. The lid will fly off the sarcophagus, and out will step a Mummy! Again, the Mummy will attack the Hero who is carrying the pendant.

If the Heroes simply drop or throw the pendant into the tomb room, Brother Hieronymus will snatch it up gleefully and disappear back into his sarcophagus, never to bother anyone again. This is the only way to complete the Quest. A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so.

### **Ghoul Hunt**

#### **Players’ Information**

Morr’s Town has become infested by a nest of Ghouls! You must drive them out so that the eternal peace of the dead kings can be restored. Go into the tombs, kill every Ghoul you find, and discover their lair. You can claim a bounty of 10 GCs for each Ghoul you slay while on this Quest.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Ghoul_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Ghoul_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Ghoul_ table

The first and second Quest rooms encountered will both be stairs down to a deeper level; the third will be their lair, containing a Ghoul Chieftain and a number of Ghouls indicated by one roll on the _Ghoul_ table. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find and slay the Ghoul Chieftain.

And that’s it for this week. Except for this, arising from a discussion in the comments section of last week’s post (thanks, **b** and ****Totsuzenheni Yukimi****!)

#### I’ve No F… Fate Points Left to Give!

What happens if a Hero is penalized for searching a sarcophagus, but has no remaining Fate Points?

I must admit, it looks like I overlooked that possibility when I was writing. My bad. But fortunately, I have a great community of readers and a couple of them came up with some suggestions. The GM can use whichever solution they like – or come up with something of their own – in which case, please share it in the comments below!

**b says:** _Maybe at that point, they catch a disease from the sarcophagus, and if they already have a disease, give them a new disease with cumulative disease effects, or generate a ghost as a wandering monster at each defiled sarcophagus?_

**Totsuzenheni Yukimi says**: _If a player wants to search a sarcophagus then I suggest that GMs tell that player that their various followers and hirelings are clearly not impressed by the suggestion of ransacking the sarcophagus, and give the player a chance to change their mind. If a player goes ahead and searches a sarcophagus then they either lose a permanent Fate Point or, if they don’t have any permanent Fate Points left, then a number of their followers leave. I haven’t decided whether it’s better to have those followers leave immediately (mid-quest) or between quests._

Alternatively, the player could be fined 100 GC (or more, if 100 GC is not a sufficient deterrent. I suggested this in some of the quests, but clearly I forgot to make sure it was in all of them. Again, my bad.
