The Skeleton hero Ennio Mordini, and the story of his conquest of Lambrusco, came from another box-back story of mine: this time, _[The Nightmare Legion](http://www.solegends.com/citrr/3rr2nightmare/index.htm)_ from the _Regiments of Renown_ series. The names of the Tilean city-states in that story are typically trite for _Warhammer_ at that time, when we believed that no-one outside the English-speaking world would ever see our work and our view of Old World nations was informed by the prejudices and conventions of 20th-century British comedy. Lambrusco was named for a wine that was cheap and freely available in corner shops across the country, which my girlfriend at the time drank in heroic quantities. Organza had no particular inspiration – I was vaguely aware that it was some kind of fabric, but mostly the name sounded okay in context and I only had 30 minutes or so to write the story so I couldn’t be picky.

Like Morbius, I vaguely intended to do something more with Mordini and his war of vengeance against Tilea’s city-states, but the opportunity never came. However, he has been mentioned a few times down the years, [as this entry in the _Warhammer Wiki_ shows.](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Ennio_Mordini) And yes, his name is based on that of Italian composer [Ennio Morricone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennio_Morricone), who is best known for his iconic theme tune to the Clint Eastwood spaghetti western _The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly._ The first syllable in Mordini was chosen to suggest death.

# **NECROMANCER’S LAIR**

Deep in the Badlands beyond the Border Princes stands a ruined fortress guarding an abandoned mine – a relic of a brief period of Human exploration in this remote and forbidding place. Now, nothing living remains in the place – but it is far from empty. The name Morbius is known to a few scholars and wizards, and written in a handful of tomes of lore. Over the centuries, this powerful Liche has brewed many schemes and caused great evil, and the living seem powerless to stop him. Finally, Morbius has been tracked to his lair in the abandoned fortress and the mine beneath. The Hero who rids the world of this dread creature will win great renown, and there are other evils to be righted in this foul place.

### **Quests**

Roll once on the following table to discover why the Heroes are going into the lair of Morbius:

| D12   | Quest              |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| 1-3   | Search and Destroy |
| 4-5   | The Skull Crown    |
| 6-8   | Rescue             |
| 9-10  | Furnace of Souls   |
| 11-12 | Race Against Time  | 


### **Search and Destroy**

#### **Players’ Information**

Now that the lair of the dread Liche has been discovered, his evil can be brought to and end once and for all. Your Quest is to enter the complex, find Morbius, and destroy him.

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Liche Followers_ table

Take a Liche Character Monster Counter to represent Morbius. Generate the complex normally, except that the first two Quest rooms will be stairs down. The third Quest room is the Liche’s inner sanctum – unless the Heroes have previously met and destroyed him he will be here, along with minions generated by two rolls on the _Liche Followers_ Table. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find and kill Morbius.

### **The Skull Crown**

#### **Players’ Information**

Morbius has somehow acquired the Skull Crown – an evil magical treasure, made centuries ago by the priests of an outlawed cult in far-off Cathay. It seems that he has not yet learned how to use the Crown, and he must be stopped before he does so – for if he should master the Skull Crown, his power would increase a hundredfold, and there would be no end to his evil. Your Quest is to enter his lair and steal the Skull Crown.

On a roll of 1-9 it is actually a Hazard room, and the GM may take one Dungeon Counter – Morbius has become alerted to their presence, and is organising his forces against them. On a roll of 10-12, the Heroes have found the Skull Crown. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find the Crown and leave the complex with it.

### **Rescue**

#### **Players’ Information**

Somewhere deep within his lair, Morbius is holding a prisoner – the daughter of one of the Border Princes. Unless she can be saved, she will surely perish in one of his evil rituals. Your Quest is to find and rescue the princess – her father is offering a reward for her safe return.

There are two ways the Heroes can find the princess – as the Maiden in a Non-Player Character Hazard room, or by reaching the third Quest room in the complex. Use the Victim Character Sheet to represent her. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find the princess and escort her out of the complex. In addition to normal rewards, the princess’ father will pay the Heroes 100 GCs if she is rescued without being hurt, 20 GCs if she is rescued but wounded – and nothing at all if she is killed, of course.

### **Furnace of Souls**

#### **Players’ Information**

After decades of research, Imperial wizards have discovered the source of Morbius’ power. At the heart of his lair is the Furnace of Souls – a huge magical generator driven by the tortured ghosts of everyone he has ever killed. If this evil device can be found and destroyed, the Liche’s power will be broken – and the spirits of his victims will be able to rest in peace.

On a roll of 10-12, the Heroes have found the Furnace of Souls. Unless he has previously been encountered and destroyed, Morbius will be here, with minions generated by two rolls on the _Liche Followers_ Table. Morbius will fight to the finish to defend the Furnace of Souls – he may not Escape from a combat in this room. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find the Furnace of Souls and a Wizard must spend an entire exploration turn in the room wrecking the device.

### **Race Against Time**

#### **Players’ Information**

An evil ritual is about to take place in Morbius’ lair. It must be stopped, or the Liche’s power will be increased even further. Your Quest is to find the chamber where the ritual is taking place, and stop it before it can be completed.

On a roll of 1-9 it is actually a Hazard room, and the GM may take one Dungeon Counter – keep Wandering Monster and Character Counters separate, though, as in this Quest they are not played in the normal way. On a roll of 10-12, the Heroes have found the Liche’s inner sanctum, where the ritual is in progress – Morbius is here, along with minions generated by _all_ the Dungeon Counters the GM is holding at this point. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must destroy all the monsters in the room, and either kill Morbius.or force him to Escape.

# **EVIL CITY**

Ennio Mordini was one of the most feared and respected mercenary leaders in all of Tilea. He and his troops were so effective that many Tilean princes competed to employ them – but all were secretly afraid, for if Mordini should turn against them they would be helpless. Finally, the Dukes of Lambrusco and Organza plotted to rid themselves of this dangerous man, and Mordini’s troops were sent into a trap. Not one survived, although Mordini swore as he died that he would be avenged on the scheming princes who connived at his death. Shortly afterwards, a huge, unstoppable army of skeleton warriors marched on Lambrusco, wearing the tattered colours of Mordini’s murdered mercenaries. The city was taken by storm, and not one of the citizens escaped. Lambrusco is now a city of the dead, and the other princes of Tilea tremble at what may happen next.

### **Quests**

Roll once on the following table to discover why the Heroes are going into the dead city of Lambrusco:

| D12   | Quest                |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| 1-3   | Assassination        |
| 4-6   | Rescue               |
| 7-9   | The Heart of Shallya |
| 10-12 | The Raven Shrine     | 


### **Assassination**

#### **Players’ Information**

The princes of Tilea have decided that the only way to deal with the undead menace is to kill Mordini a second time. Your quest is to go into the city, find the Undead Warlord that was once Ennio Mordini, and destroy it.

There are no Quest rooms in this Quest, so re-roll any Quest Room results on the Room Type table. Each time the Heroes encounter an Undead Champion (before any combat takes place), roll a D12: on a roll of 10-12 they have actually encountered Ennio Mordini – an Undead Warlord! Roll once on the _Undead Warlord Followers_ table and add the result to the monsters for this encounter. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find and destroy the Undead Warlord.

### **Rescue**

#### **Players’ Information**

Word has reached neighbouring princes that there is a single living person still in Lambrusco – the youngest daughter of the Duke. How she escaped the slaughter, no-one knows. Perhaps she was able to hide, or perhaps Mordini is keeping her alive until he can think of a suitable fate for her. In any event, she must be rescued from the clutches of the Undead Warlord! The Duke of Organza has offered a reward for her rescue.

### **The Heart of Shallya**

#### **Players’ Information**

Hidden in a shrine somewhere in the city is the Heart of Shallya – a powerful artefact of Good. Surrounded by so much evil, its powers are beginning to wane, and it must be recovered before it is destroyed altogether.

On a roll of 1-9 it is actually a Hazard room, and the GM may take one Dungeon Counter – Mordini has become alerted to their presence, and is organising his forces against them. On a roll of 10-12, the Heroes have found the shrine containing the Heart of Shallya.

To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find the Heart and leave the complex with it. The Heart of Shallya can cast Flames of the Phoenix three times, and Power of the Phoenix once, even in the hands of a non-Wizard. The Heroes may use the Heart to heal themselves while on the Quest, but may not keep it after the Quest is over.

### **The Raven Shrine**

#### **Players’ Information**

Somewhere in the city is a shrine sacred to Morr, the guardian of the dead. Morr is opposed to all undead, and if the shrine can be found, a short ritual conducted there will weaken the power of the Undead in Lambrusco considerably. Your quest is to escort a priest into the city, find the shrine, and protect him while he conducts the ritual.

A Priest Character Sheet is given elsewhere in this book. Each time the Heroes discover a Quest room, roll a D12: on a roll of 1-9 it is a set of stairs down, on a roll of 10 or more it is the shrine. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must reach this room with the priest, who must then spend a full exploration turn here to complete his funeral ritual. After the ritual has been completed, all undead creatures encountered will have half their normal **W** score. A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so.
