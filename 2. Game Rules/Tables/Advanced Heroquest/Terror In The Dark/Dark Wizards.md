Carrying on from the previous posts ([Fiction,](https://graemedavis.wordpress.com/2024/11/02/advanced-heroquest-some-outtakes-i-found/) [New Hazards,](https://graemedavis.wordpress.com/2024/11/09/advanced-heroquest-new-hazards/) and [Undead Monsters](https://graemedavis.wordpress.com/2024/11/16/advanced-heroquest-undead-monsters/)), here are some more outtakes from my manuscript for _Advanced Heroquest Undead Supplement,_ parts of which became _Terror in the Dark._ This time, as promised, it’s Dark Wizards.

_Terror in the Dark_ includes rules and spells for Light Wizards, and my original plan was to add Dark Wizards as well, to support spellcasting enemies such as Liches and some Vampires. Carl gave Liches two new spells, which weren’t included in my manuscript: here are some more.

# **The Dark Wizards**

The Wizards of the Dark College are regarded with fear and distrust by all decent folk. Although not all evil Wizards belong to the Dark College, it is certainly true that all Dark Wizards are evil. They are searchers in forbidden places, desecrators of tombs, and they violate the most sacred laws of life and death. The **Advanced Heroquest** rulebook features a few Dark Wizards in its section of reference tables; the following pages give full drtails of the Dark College and its magic, since most of the spellcasters listed in **Undead** are Dark Wizards. Dark Wizard spells cannot be learned by Heroes.

The colour of the Dark Wizards is black, although some may also use dark greys and browns. Their symbol is an eight-spoked wheel, or an eight-pointed star, or a spider in its web; the eight spokes, or points, or strands of the web symbolise the main tenet of the Dark College – that someone who has the power can move in any direction he pleases, and do anything he pleases. Another symbol favoured by the Dark Wizards is a black triangle, point-down. According to magical theory, above all colours is light and beneath all colours is darkness – the triangle symbolises the ‘Cone of Darkness’ upon which stand all colours of magic.

Among some evil races, such as Skaven, Dark Wizards hold a respected position. Among Humans and other good races, they are feared and outcast. Dark Wizards are usually contemptuous of all others, and keep themselves to themselves, although they may have servants and followers of their own. They are unlikely to have many friends, however. Necromancers, Liches, Vampires and many other kinds of evil Wizards belong to the Dark College.

Like Wizards of other Colleges, Dark Wizards each have a spell book, and may only use those spells which they have learned and inscribed in their spell books. The following page gives the Dark Wizard’s spell book in full.

## **Random Spells**

Evil spellcasters in the **Advanced Heroquest** rulebook are given specific spells, but it can be a lot more interesting if spells are chosen randomly, so that the Heroes – and their players – never know what an encountered evil spellcaster might throw at them!

The spellcasting creatures listed of this book each have a number of spells – for example, a Liche can cast 5 Dark Wizard spells. When a spellcasting creature is encountered, use the following table to find out what spells he – or it – can cast. Roll once for each spell the creature can cast.

Don’t worry if you roll a particular spell more than once – that just means that the creature can cast it more than once.

You can allot random spells to the spellcasting creatures listed in the **Advanced Heroquest** rulebook, if you like – simply ignore the spells given on their reference sheets and roll on the table above, as follows:

## **Dark Wizard’s Spell Book**

_Note: There’s a note in my manuscript which specifically says that none of the spells listed should be marked as starting spells. I don’t remember why, exactly, but it was probably to support random generation of spells._

**CHOKE**

**Component:** Vial of Swamp Gas

The victim suddenly clutches his throat and has great trouble breathing. Dark wisps of smoke begin to seep from his mouth and nostrils as his lungs fill with noxious fumes.

Select a single target within the caster’s line of sight. The target may only stagger one square per turn for the next 3 turns (the model’s player makes this move). Unless the caster has been killed in the meantime, the victim dies from asphyxiation at the end of the third turn.

**FIREBALL**

**Component:** Pinch of Warpstone

A ball of black fire with blue and yellow flames licking at the edges hurtles from the caster’s hand towards the chosen target. Place a fireball template anywhere within 12 squares of the caster along his line of sight. Any models (friend or foe) which fall wholly or partly under the fireball template are automatically hit. Roll 5 damage dice to see what effect each hit has.

**FLAMING SKULL OF TERROR**

**Component:** Silver Daemon Statue

As he finishes the incantation, the caster seems to grow horns and fangs, his fingers lengthen into great talons, huge scale fall over his eyes and he utters a bestial roar. He is treated as a Fearsome monster until play next returns to exploration turns.

**CREATE UNDEAD SERVANTS**

**Component:** Enchanted Bone

As the caster finishes his incantation, the ground begins to heave slightly, then buckles upwards as four Skeletons pull themselves out of the earth, ready to obey his commands. Place a fireball template anywhere withing 12 squares of the caster, along his line of sight. The template may not be placed wholly or partly in the death zone of any living creature. The Skeletons appear in the area covered by the template, one to a square.

**SPECTRAL HAND**

**Component:** Dried hand of hanged criminal

The caster gestures with the hand, and a spectral blow strikes one living creature within 12 squares of the caster along his line of sight. The blow automatically connects, and the caster rolls 2 damage dice. Armour does _not_ add to the target’s Toughness unless it is magical. The Spectral Hand is capable of wounding Invulnerable creatures as if they weren’t Invulnerable.

**BECOME ETHEREAL**

**Component:** Vial of grave dust

As the caster chants the incantation for this spell, his body becomes less solid, until it is possible to see right through it. When the incantation is complete, the caster is _ethereal_ – just like an Ethereal monster (see [previous post](https://graemedavis.wordpress.com/2024/11/16/advanced-heroquest-undead-monsters/)). He can walk through walls, locked doors and other obstructions. It can also fly over hazards like pits and chasms. Because he isn’t solid, he can’t attack other creatures with non-magical hand-to-hand or ranged weapons, and normal weapons simply pass right through him, causing no damage at all. Magical weapons and spells cause damage as normal. The spell lasts until the beginning of the nest exploration turn.

**STEAL LIFE**

**Component:** Coffin splinter

The caster points at a single living creature within 12 squares along his line of sight, and tendrils of black mist begin to rise from the ground around this chosen victim. They wrap around the victim’s legs, draining the life-energy from him. The victim loses as many Wounds as are shown by the roll of one dice; do not roll conventional damage dice for this spell. The spell automatically dies down at the end of the next turn.

**VORTEX OF CHAOS**

**Component:** Pinch of Warpstone dust

The caster flings the Warpstone dust into the air, and it gathers into a terrifying whirlwind of primal Chaos, one square wide, and moves directly away from him for 12 squares before dissipating. As it moves, it destroys everything it touches, sucking it into the heart of Chaos where it is lost forever.

The Vortex makes a hole in any wall it encounters, just like the Bright Wizards’ spell The Bright Key. When it encounters a hazard or other feature, it destroys it. When the Vortex passes through the death zone of a Hero or monster, roll a dice and compare it to the model’s Speed; if the dice roll is equal to or less than the model’s Speed, it has avoided the vortex, otherwise it is sucked into Chaos and destroyed. Heroes may expend a Fate Point to avoid this.

**BEAM OF CHAOS**

**Component:** Polished Warpstone lens

By uttering the incantation, the caster causes light to be focussed through the Warpstone lens, picking up some of the essence of Chaos in the process. The result is a beam of roiling green light projecting 12 squares long along the caster’s line of sight. The beam has no effect on stone walls and other obstructions, but every living thing in the line of the beam must expend a Fate Point or lose Wounds equal to the score rolled on two dice; do not roll conventional damage dice for this spell.

**WALL OF DARKNESS**

**Component:** Scrap of a Ghost’s winding-sheet

As he finishes the incantation, the caster holds the scrap of cloth in the air, and it appears to expand and darken, making a wall of darkness up to 12 squares wide, 2 squares deep and as high as the passage or room. The wall of darkness block line of sight, and ranged weapons cannot be thrown or fired through it; neither can spells. Living creatures – including Heroes – must make a successful test against Bravery to enter the darkness. The spell lasts until the beginning of the nest exploration turn.

**ZONE AGAINST LIFE**

**Component:** Small bag of grave earth

The caster draws a circle on the floor with the earth as he chants the incantation. Living creatures – including Heroes – cannot cross the line until the beginning of the next exploration turn, although ranged weapons may be thrown or fired into the circle. Undead creatures inside the circle add 3 to their Toughness; this bonus is lost if they move out of the circle, or when the spell ends.

**SUMMON UNDEAD CHAMPION**

**Component:** Dragon tooth

Completing the incantation, the caster throws the Dragon tooth onto the ground – on any square in his death zone which is not already occupied – and an Undead Champion appears on the spot, ready to follow the caster’s orders. Once summoned, an Undead Champion remains until destroyed. If the caster of the summoning spell is killed, the Undead Champion attacks the nearest living creature, and continues to do so until no more living creatures are in sight. Then it becomes dormant until a living creature enters its line of sight again.

So there you have it. Just one note on the spell components – I was clearly just making things up. As far as I know, none of these items actually exists in **Heroquest** or **Advanced Heroquest,** so if you enforce spell components strictly in your game, I’m afraid you’re on your own.
