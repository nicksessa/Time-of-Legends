# **NEW EQUIPMENT**

Heroes who are going hunting undead can invest in a range of specialized equipment to help them in their Quests. This section gives you the costs and some special rules for various items that will be useful against undead.

### **Stake and Mallet**

The surest way to deal with a Vampire is by staking it through the heart. This is easy enough if you can catch the Vampire sleeping in its coffin, but when you’re faced with a fully awake and distinctly hostile Vampire Lord in the darkness of the catacombs, it’s easier said than done!

The stake and mallet occupy both hands – a Hero can’t use a shield while wielding them, and loses the Toughness bonus (optional rule: he may still claim the Toughness bonus against attacks from the three squares to his rear, since his is carrying the shield slung over his back).

The stake and mallet is an unwieldy weapon, to say the least – a Hero trying to stake a Vampire in hand-to-hand combat suffers a -4 penalty to all hit rolls. It cannot score a critical hit, and it fumbles on a roll of 4 or less. However, if the attack is successful there is no need to roll damage dice – the Vampire is automatically destroyed unless the GM uses a Fate Dungeon Counter to convert the success into a failure.

### **Garlic**

Garlic is a popular folk-remedy against Vampires. A Vampire attacking Hero who wears a garland of garlic around his neck in hand-to-hand combat suffer a -2 penalty to all hit rolls.

### **Blessed Weapons**

In exchange for a small donation to their temple, many priests will bless a weapon, making it more effective against undead. If you use Priest Hero from the **Advanced Heroquest Companion**, note that priests controlled by players cannot do this – only those who are safely settled in their own temples and don’t go adventuring hsave the time to learn rituals like this!

A blessed weapon rolls one extra damage die when rolling to wound an undead target. However, blessings don’t last for ever – before the player makes the wound roll, the GM should roll a D12 – on a result of 1, the blessing has worn off and the weapon only rolls the normal number of damage dice!

### **Holy Water**

Holy water can be obtained from temples between expeditions. A flask of holy water is a ranged weapon, with a maximum range of 4. It can be thrown even if the Hero has moved that turn. If it hits an undead creature or a Daemon (ie a Daemonette, Bloodthirster or Greater Daemon of Tzeentch), the holy water rolls a number of damage dice equal to the target’s Toughness score. The more powerful an undead creature or Daemon is, the better chance the holy water has of hurting it!

### **Mirror**

Vampires and spirits (Ghosts, Specters, Wights and Wraiths) don’t reflect in mirrors, and the fact seems to upset them quite a bit. Holding up a mirror to a Vampire or spirit will repel it, so that it must make a Bravery test in order to enter the Hero’s death zone. Note that a Hero must be _facing_ a creature in order to hold up a mirror to it!

### **Salt**

Due to a peculiarity in the magical process by which they are made, Zombies simply can’t stand salt. This weakness can be used by Heroes in two ways:

If a bag of salt is sprinkled on the floor, no Zombie can enter that square. A Hero can only sprinkle salt into a square in his death zone. The salt remains there permanently – it can’t be gathered up and used again!

A bag of salt can be thrown at a Zombie as a missile. It has a range of 3 squares, and can be thrown even if the Hero has moved that turn. If it hits a Zombie it causes no damage as such, but the Zombie must roll its Toughness or less on a D12 or it is immediately destroyed. The bag bursts on contact with the Zombie (or with the floor if the throw is missed), and cannot be used again. If the throw misses, roll on the table for Skaven Plague Censers in the **Advanced Heroquest** rulebook to find out where it landed.

Card counters are provided for marking squares which are filled with salt.
