### CEMETERY

The great burial-ground of Deedesveld covers almost half of the island of Riddra in the great city-port of Marienburg. Centuries ago, the site was occupied by the living – a great thieves’ kitchen called Breedmoers, full of rogues of every kind. The authorities despaired of ever bringing law to the place, and razed it to the ground, using the land for a cemetery. But some say that smugglers’ caves and passages may still be found in the rock beneath the tombs, and that the dead of Deedesveld are as active as the living who may still be found there…

### **Quests**

Roll once on the following table to discover why the Heroes are going into the Deedesveld graveyard:

| **D12 | Quest**                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| 1-3   | Find the Smugglers           |
| 4-6   | Destroy the Wreckers’ Shrine |
| 7     | Morr’s Quest                 |
| 8-10  | Ghoul Hunt                   |
| 11-12 | The Captain’s Helm           | 

### **Find the Smugglers**

#### **Players’ Information**

Among the passages and catacombs of Deedesveld are the remains of basements and tunnels dating back to the time of Breedmoers. Many of them are still used by smugglers to land and store illicit cargoes under the very noses of the authorities. There is a standing reward for the capture of smugglers and their cargoes – just the sort of ‘odd job’ that Heroes do in between major Quests.

**Wandering Monsters:** see below

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** see below

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

Whenever you need to generate lair occupants or wandering monsters, roll a D12. On a roll of 1-8, use the _Unoccupied Complex_ table; on a roll of 9-12, use the _Undead Lairs_ table, re-rolling a result of 12. Generate the tomb complex in the normal way, except that Quest rooms will always be stairs down.

Each time the Heroes find a secret door, you should roll a D12 – a roll of 12 or more means that they have found the smugglers’ lair. Add 1 for each secret door they have already discovered, and 1 for each Fate Point they spend to increase their chances. Players must decide to spend Fate Points before the dice is rolled.

The smugglers count as 3 men-at-arms and 1 sergeant, but are armed with swords instead of halberds. The Heroes get 10GCs for each smuggler they kill – how they divide up the money is up to them. Any Hero who searches a sarcophagus on this Quest must spend a Fate Point or pay a 50GC fine at the end of the Quest.

### **Destroy the Wreckers’ Shrine**

#### **Players’ Information**

The graveyard of Deedesveld stands atop steep cliffs, and wreckers sometimes light false beacons there to lure ships to their doom on the rocks below. Some wreckers are simple criminals, who steal the cargo from the ships they run aground; others are followers of the evil cult of Stromfels, who cause the deaths of innocent mariners to further their dark designs. The authorities of Marienburg have found evidence of a wrecker-cult operating from Deedesveld, and suspect that there is a shrine of the cult of Stromfels somewhere in the passages beneath it. Your Quest is to find and destroy the evil shrine.

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

Whenever you need to generate lair occupants or wandering monsters, roll a D12. On a roll of 1-8, use the _Unoccupied Complex_ table; on a roll of 9-12, use the _Undead Lairs_ table, re-rolling a result of 12. Any tomb robbers encountered will in fact be wreckers. Generate the complex normally, except that the first two Quest rooms will be stairs down. The third will be the wreckers’ shrine.

To complete the Quest, the Heroes must spend a full exploration turn there, destroying the trappings of the evil cult. They will receive a reward of 50GCs for finding and destroying the shrine, plus a bounty of 10GCs for each wrecker they kill. Any Hero who searches a sarcophagus on this Quest must spend a Fate Point or pay a 50GC fine at the end of the Quest.

### **Morr’s Quest**

#### **Players’ Information**

The Heroes have each received a vision from Morr, the guardian of the dead. A burial took place two days ago in Deedesveld, but the young man who was buried wasn’t dead – he was only in a coma. The Heroes must find and rescue him before he truly dies, otherwise he might become a terrible undead monster! According to the vision, the young man’s tomb was on the third level below ground, but other than that, the Heroes must find it for themselves.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** see below

**Wandering Monsters:** see below

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** see below

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

This Quest is failed if it is not completed in a single visit – the young man must be rescued quickly! Whenever you need to generate lair occupants or wandering monsters, roll a D12. On a roll of 1-8, use the _Unoccupied Complex_ table; on a roll of 9-12, use the _Undead Lairs_ table, re-rolling a result of 12. Generate the complex normally, except that the first two Quest rooms will be stairs down.

There are no Quest rooms on the third level – re-roll any rolls which generate a Quest room. On the third level, roll a D12 each time the Heroes find a sarcophagus, adding 1 for each sarcophagus they have discovered on the third level, and 1 for each Fate Point they spend to increase their chances. Players must decide to spend Fate Points before the dice is rolled. On a roll of 12 they have found the unfortunate young man who was buried alive. Use the Victim Character Sheet for him.

If the Heroes get the young man out of the graveyard alive, they each gain 1 Fate Point, as a blessing from Morr. Any Hero who searches a sarcophagus on this Quest – except on the third level – must spend a Fate Point or pay a 50GC fine at the end of the Quest. The same applies to any Hero who takes treasure from a sarcophagus on the third level.

### **Ghoul Hunt**

#### **Players’ Information**

Deedesveld has become infested by a nest of Ghouls! You must go into the tombs, kill every Ghoul you find, and discover their lair. You can claim a bounty of 10 GCs for each Ghoul you slay while on this Quest.

**Lair Occupants:** see below

**Wandering Monsters:** _Undead Wandering Monsters_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Ghoul_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Ghoul_ table

The first and second Quest rooms encountered will both be stairs down to a deeper level; the third will be their lair, containing a Ghoul Chieftain and a number of Ghouls indicated by one roll on the _Ghoul_ table. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find and slay the Ghoul Chieftain.

### **The Captain’s Helm**

#### **Players’ Information**

Captain Karl Avermans was a great Hero who fought to save Marienburg from the forces of Chaos two hundred years ago. He was buried in a great tomb in Deedesveld, and has lain there ever since. Now, on the 200th anniversary of his death, a new monument is to be built, in the middle of the city. The authorities want to recover the Captain’s helmet from his tomb, so that it can be displayed on top of the new monument.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** see below

**Wandering Monsters:** see below

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** see below

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

Whenever you need to generate lair occupants or wandering monsters, roll a D12. On a roll of 1-8, use the _Unoccupied Complex_ table; on a roll of 9-12, use the _Undead Lairs_ table, re-rolling a result of 12. Generate the complex normally, except that the first two Quest rooms will be stairs down. The third Quest room is the tomb of Captain Avermans.

Although he fought heroically against Chaos, it has had its effect on him – he is now a Ghoul Chieftain, and will fight intruders until destroyed. Once he has been dealt with, the Heroes can recover his helmet and take it back to the authorities to claim a 50GC reward. Any Hero who searches a sarcophagus on this Quest must spend a Fate Point or pay a 50GC fine at the end of the Quest.

# **PLACE OF LEGEND**

Deep in the forests of the Yetzin Valley, on the fringes of the Border Princes, stands a monument known to the locals as The Watchers on the Hill. A wide circle of standing stones, it was raised thousands of years ago by the followers of the Old Faith. A complex of tunnels and chambers was made beneath the stones and for centuries it served as a sanctuary for all those who followed this cult of nature, until a hundred years ago the Yetzin Valley was overrun by an army of Orcs. The complex was all but destroyed, and all in it perished. Now, some explorers have returned from these wild lands claiming to have found the Watchers on the Hill, just as the Orcs left the place.

### **Quests**

Roll once on the following table to discover why the Heroes are going into the underground complex beneath the stone circle:

| D12   | Quest               |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| 1-3   | Monster Hunt        |
| 4-6   | The Crystal of Fire |
| 7-9   | Cleanse the Shrine  |
| 10-12 | Torgoch’s Kin       | 


### **Monster Hunt**

#### **Players’ Information**

The first stage in restoring this holy place is to clear out the monsters that have infested it since the Orcs came. The Orcs are all dead now – they left the valley after only a few years – but other creatures have entered the desecrated complex in the Orcs’ wake.

There are no stairs out (other than those the Heroes came in by), so replace this result on the _Passage End_ table with Dead End. The Quest ends when the Heroes have completely cleared the complex of monsters – when every passage has been followed to a dead end and no more doors remain to be opened. This may take some time! There is no Quest room on the third level – re-roll this result if it is generated by the _Room Type_ table.

### **The Crystal of Fire**

#### **Players’ Information**

The Orc chieftain, Torgoch, is said to lie somewhere in the complex, along with his magical Crystal of Fire. This powerful magical treasure enabled him to conquer most of the Yetzin valley, but his troops began fighting among themselves and deserted him. The Crystal of Fire is the kind of treasure which few Heroes can resist!

**Lair Occupants:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

There are no stairs out (other than those the Heroes came in by), so replace this result on the _Passage End_ table with Dead End. The third Quest room is the chamber where Torgoch lies with his magical treasure. Torgoch is a Liche, and will fight until destroyed, using the Crystal of Fire. The Crystal can be used by any wizard, and can cast each spell of the Bright Wizards once per day, without any need for components – it can even cast spells its user doesn’t know!

### **Cleanse the Shrine**

#### **Players’ Information**

At the heart of the complex lies a powerful shrine of the Old Faith, said to have been carved out of an immense Dawnstone the size of a house. The Heroes must find this shrine and re-dedicate it, by leaving a smaller Dawnstone there to reactivate the shrine’s powers.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

There are no stairs out (other than those the Heroes came in by), so replace this result on the _Passage End table_ with Dead End. The third Quest room is the shrine at the heart of the complex.

The Heroes have a Dawnstone (with 12 Fate Points) at the start of the quest, which they must leave in the shrine. This is a normal Dawnstone as described in the **Advanced Heroquest** rulebook, and the Heroes may use it if they need to during the Quest. However, each time they use the Dawnstone they place their Quest in jeopardy.

When the Heroes reach the shrine, roll a D12. If the result is equal to or less than the number of Fate Points left in the Dawnstone, the shrine is successfully re-activated and the Quest has been successful  if not, the Dawnstone does not have enough power left and the Quest has failed! Heroes who complete the Quest successfully gain 1 Fate Point each.

### **Torgoch’s Kin**

#### **Players’ Information**

The Orc chieftain, Torgoch, is said to lie somewhere in the complex, along with his magical Crystal of Fire. Now, a descendant of his named Radzog has come to claim the treasure, at the head of another Orc army! Unless the Heroes can get to the Crystal first, the consequences could be terrible.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table, but re-roll all Skaven, Tomb Robbers and Chaos Thugs results

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table, but re-roll all Skaven, Tomb Robbers and Chaos Thugs results

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

Take a Chaos Sorcerer Character Monster Counter to represent Radzog. He has the statistics and weapons of an Orc Warchief, but uses the same spells as a Chaos Sorcerer – you will find both in the **Advanced Heroquest** rulebook.

The first two Quest rooms will be stairs down. There are no stairs out (other than those the Heroes came in by), so replace this result on the _Passage End_ table with Dead End.

Each time the Heroes encounter a Quest room on the third level of the complex, roll a D12. On a roll of 1-9 it is actually a Hazard room, and the GM may take one Dungeon Counter – the Orcs are well ahead of the Heroes, and consolidating their position in the complex! On a roll of 10-12, the Quest room is the chamber where Torgoch lies with his magical treasure.

If the Heroes haven’t met and killed Radzog elsewhere, he will be in this room, with the Crystal of Fire and minions represented by any unused Dungeon counters. He will use the Crystal of Fire against the Heroes, and will fight to the death rather than surrender it. The Quest ends when Radzog is killed and the Heroes have captured the Crystal and taken it out of the complex. The Crystal can be used by any wizard, and can cast each spell of the Bright Wizards once per day, without any need for components – it can even cast spells its user doesn’t know!
