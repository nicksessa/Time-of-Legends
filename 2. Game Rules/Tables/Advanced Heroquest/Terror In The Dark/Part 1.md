# The Quest Machine

The rules and tables in this section will allow you to create an almost endless variety of quests for your Advanced Heroquest games. Each quest will have its own story, its own villain and its own rewards at the end – and no two will even be alike!

You should generate the details of the quest immediately before starting play. Be sure to keep notes, as certain details of the quest will affect things later on in the game. By the time the Heroes are ready to set out, they will know exactly where they are going and what they have to do.

### **THE PLACE**

There are all sorts of places where a band of Heroes might encounter undead creatures. Your first job is to find out where the quest will take place, and what the place is like. Roll on the _Place Table_.

#### **The Place Table**

Roll a D12 to determine whether the place is good, neutral or evil. The roll again to discover what type of place it is.

**_For example:_** _Your first roll is a 3 – indicating that the place is good. Your second roll is a 7, so you refer to the Good column of the table and find out that it is a Monastery Catacomb._

|     | 1-2: Good          | 3-4: Neutral            | 5-6: Evil          |
| --- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1   | Royal Tombs        | Cemetery                | Necromancer's Lair |
| 2   | Monument           | Place of Legend         | Evil City          |
| 3   | Monastery Catacomb | Underground Battlefield | Overrun Necropolis |
| 4   | Sanctuary of Morr  | Dwarfhold Tomb Complex  | Vampire's Lair     | 

The following sections give you further information on each place, and tell you what to do next.

### **ROYAL TOMBS**

In the distant past, the area now occupied by the Empire was home to several great tribes of farmers and hunters. One of these was the Unberognens – it was from this tribe that Sigmar himself sprang. Centuries ago, according to scholars, the great royal house of the Unberogens buried their dead in a vast complex of rock-cut tombs beneath the Grey Mountains. The dead kings lie still beneath the peaks, and their treasure is said to be considerable. Adventurers still whisper of Borla’s Crown, the Sword of Valduric, and the Dragon Shield of Forris the Strong. They whisper, too, of the deadly traps and magical guardians that protect them. Now, according to rumour, a prospector in the Grey Mountains has found the lost entrance to the Unberogen tombs.

### **Quests**

Roll once on the following table to discover why the Heroes are going into the royal tombs:


| roll: 1d12 | Quest                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| 1-3        | Find Borla’s Crown          |
| 4-5        | Find the Sword of Valduric  |
| 6-7        | Replace the Dragon Shield   |
| 8-10       | Ghoul Hunt                  |
| 11-12      | Cleanse the Shrine of Osric |

### **Find Borla’s Crown**

#### **Players’ Information**

Civil war is imminent. Several renegade nobles are secretly gathering armies to depose the Emperor. They are led by Duke Albrecht, who claims descent from the ancient Unberogen king Borla. If you can find the Crown and get it to the Emperor, civil war may be averted. If it falls into the hands of the rebels, an uprising is sure to follow. The Emperor himself has ordered this quest, and you have been chosen. As loyal citizens, you do not refuse. If you succeed, you will be given 100 gold crowns each. You may keep anything you find in the tombs except Borla’s Crown – but you may not loot any tombs. Duke Albrecht has already sent his own followers out to find the Crown, so time is of the essence!

**Wandering Monsters:** _Unoccupied Complex_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Opposition_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Opposition_ table

Heroes who search any sarcophagus lose a Fate Point each time they do so – a just punishment for their sacrilege!

The first two Quest rooms the Heroes encounter will be stairs down; the third will be Borla’s tomb. The Tomb is a small room with one door; the sarcophagus is in the centre. The Crown is resting on the sarcophagus.

To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find Borla’s Tomb and at least one of them must leave the complex with the Crown. They may not keep the Crown after the Quest.

### **Find the Sword of Valduric**

#### **Players’ Information**

The great Hero Valduric destroyed the terrible Bloodthirster Ravax Gorespite seven centuries ago. Valduric was so badly wounded that he died shortly after the battle, and in honour of his service the Emperor decreed that he should be buried in the royal tombs, along with his sword. Now, a Chaos Sorcerer has succeeded in summoning Gorespite back from the void, and only the Sword of Valduric can save the day. You must find Valduric’s tomb, retrieve the Sword, and bring it back so that the Bloodthirster can be destroyed once more.

### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Unoccupied Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Chaos Sorcerer Followers_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Chaos Sorcerer Followers_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Chaos Sorcerer Followers_ table

If a Bloodthirster is generated, it is Gorespite himself, come to stop the Heroes finding the sword! Generate the tomb complex in the normal way, except that Quest rooms will always be stairs down.

Each time the Heroes find a sarcophagus, you should roll a D12 – a roll of 12 or more means that they have found the tomb of Valduric. Add 1 for each sarcophagus they have already discovered, and 1 for each Fate Point they spend to increase their chances. Players must decide to spend Fate Points before the dice is rolled. The sarcophagus contains only the sword and the bones of Valduric.

There are two ways to complete the Quest, once the Heroes have found the sword: one or more of them may take it out of the complex, or they may encounter Gorespite and kill him. The Sword of Valduric is a magical weapon – it can hit Invulnerable monsters just as if they weren’t Invulnerable, and it does double damage against Bloodthirsters. The Heroes may not keep the sword after the Quest.

### **Replace the Dragon Shield**

#### **Players’ Information**

The famous Dragon Shield of Forris the Strong has been stolen from the royal tombs! The tomb-robbers were caught, and are now in jail awaiting their punishment. Meanwhile, you are to take the Dragon Shield back to the royal tombs and replace it in Forris’ tomb where it belongs. You may not loot any tombs while on this Quest.

**Wandering Monsters:** _Unoccupied Complex_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Unoccupied Complex_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

The first two Quest rooms will be stairs down. The third will be Forris’ tomb. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find Forris’ tomb and leave the Dragon Shield there. They may use the shield on the way – it is magical, giving its wielder Toughness +2 without reducing Speed. Bow Skill is reduced by -1, though, and a Hero may not use a two-handed sword, axe or halberd while carrying the shield.

Any Hero who searches a sarcophagus during the course of this Quest must spend a Fate Point or pay a 100 GC fine at the end of the Quest.

### **Ghoul Hunt**

#### **Players’ Information**

The royal tombs have become infested by a nest of Ghouls! You must drive them out so that the eternal peace of the dead kings can be restored. Go into the tombs, kill every Ghoul you find, and discover their lair. You can claim a bounty of 10 GCs for each Ghoul you slay while on this Quest.

### **Cleanse the Shrine of Osric**

#### **Players’ Information**

The royal tombs have been broken into by followers of Chaos, and the great Shrine of Osric has been desecrated! You must wipe out the evil followers of Chaos, find the shrine, and cleanse it of their desecration by sprinkling holy water all over the room.

Lesser shrines (ie those generated by the _Hazard_ table) have been left intact. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find the shrine, and spend one exploration turn sprinkling it with holy water – if they have no holy water by the time they arrive, their Quest fails.

### **MONUMENT**

Near the Tsar’s palace in the city of Kislev stands the Hill of Heroes, a great monument to the thousands who fell defending the land against the hordes of Chaos two hundred years ago. Thousands of warriors from all over the Old World rest in the tunnels beneath the Hill of Heroes, for it was not far from here that the final battle was fought and the tide of Chaos was turned back from engulfing the whole world.

### **Quests**

Roll once on the following table to discover why the Heroes are going into the Hill of Heroes:


| roll: 1d12 | Quest                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| 1-3        | The Banner of the Bear |
| 4-5        | The Army of Death      |
| 6-7        | Chaos Returns          |
| 8-10       | Ghoul Hunt             |
| 11-12      | The Vampire            |

### **The Banner of the Bear**

#### **Players’ Information**

The Ranger-Knights of the Brotherhood of the Bear fought valiantly against Chaos, and they are still one of the elite units of the army of Kislev. Their first banner, said to have been blessed by Taal the Lord of the Wilds, is buried beneath the Hill of Heroes along with Kralyevitch Ivan, the greatest of the Brotherhood to fall in the Chaos Wars. A new chapel is being built for the Brotherhood in the Tsar’s palace itself, and it has been decreed that the Banner of the Bear should hang here in memory of their great deeds. Your Quest is to explore the Hill of Heroes, find the Banner of the Bear, and bring it back. You may not loot any tombs during this Quest.

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

Each time the Heroes discover a Quest room, roll a D12: on a roll of 1-9 it is a set of stairs down, on a roll of 10 or more it is the tomb of Kralyevitch Ivan. This is a small room containing a sarcophagus and the banner.

To complete the Quest, the Heroes must reach the tomb, and one or more of them must leave the complex carrying the banner. The Banner of the Bear is magical, and a Hero who is carrying the banner counts as Fearsome to animals (such as rats) and to creatures and followers of Chaos. A Hero who is carrying the banner may not cast spells or use a bow, two- handed weapon or halberd – one hand must always be free to hold the banner.

A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so. The Heroes may not keep the Banner of the Bear after the Quest.

### **The Army of Death**

#### **Players’ Information**

The Necromancer Vlad Bathek has broken into the Hill of Heroes, and is preparing to raise a vast undead army to overthrow the Tsar! You must find the evil Necromancer and thwart his plans – but hurry, for his power grows with each passing hour!

Take a Necromancer Character Monster Counter to represent Vlad Bathek. Each time the Heroes encounter a Quest room, roll a D12. On a roll of 1-9 it is actually a Hazard room, and the GM may take one Dungeon Counter – time is getting shorter, and Bathek’s undead minions are growing more numerous! On a roll of 10-12, the Heroes have found Bathek’s lair – he is here (unless he has previously been encountered and killed) with one roll of minions from the _Necromancer Followers_ table.

To complete the Quest, the Heroes must meet and kill Vlad Bathek.

### **Chaos Returns**

#### **Players’ Information**

The minions of Chaos have infiltrated the Hill of Heroes, and are preparing to conduct a ghastly ritual in the monument to their defeat. Even now, they are hiding in the tunnels, raising the dead to serve their foul cause and summoning creatures of Chaos to help them in their work. You must find the place where they are conducting their obscene rituals and wipe them out.

On a roll of 10-12, the Heroes have found the ritual room. It is a large room containing a Chaos Sorcerer and additional monsters generated by a roll on the _Chaos Sorcerer Followers_ table. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find the ritual room and slay everything in it.

### **Ghoul Hunt**

#### **Players’ Information**

The Hill of Heroes has become infested by a nest of Ghouls! You must drive them out so that the eternal peace of the dead heroes can be restored. Go into the tombs, kill every Ghoul you find, and discover their lair. You can claim a bounty of 10 GCs for each Ghoul you slay while on this Quest.

### **The Vampire**

#### **Players’ Information**

The infamous Vampire Radu Vrolyetsin has made his lair in the Hill of Heroes – he must be found and destroyed.

The first and second Quest rooms encountered will both be stairs down. The third Quest room is the Vampire’s lair, containing the sarcophagus where he sleeps. If Vrolyetsin has not already been destroyed he will be here; he may not Escape from a combat in this room, as he must defend his sarcophagus. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find and destroy the Vampire Lord.
