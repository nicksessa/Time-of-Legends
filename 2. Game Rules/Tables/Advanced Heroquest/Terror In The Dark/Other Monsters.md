Carrying on from the previous posts ([Fiction,](https://graemedavis.wordpress.com/2024/11/02/advanced-heroquest-some-outtakes-i-found/) [New Hazards,](https://graemedavis.wordpress.com/2024/11/09/advanced-heroquest-new-hazards/) [Undead Monsters](https://graemedavis.wordpress.com/2024/11/16/advanced-heroquest-undead-monsters/), and [Dark Wizards](https://graemedavis.wordpress.com/2024/11/23/advanced-heroquest-dark-wizards/)), here are some more outtakes from my manuscript for _Advanced Heroquest Undead Supplement,_ parts of which became _Terror in the Dark._ This time, it’s a selection of non-Undead creatures that might be found in the same dusty, cursed labyrinths as Undead.

Some of them are based on Citadel Miniatures, and some are not. I was giving my imaginations pretty free rein while writing this, and that may be why this section, in particular, did not appear in print.

# **GIANT ANIMALS**

In remote places and isolated underground complexes, some animals can grow to immense size. A bat may be harmless enough, but when it grows to four feet long it becomes a savage and dangerous predator. Snakes, beetles, rats and spiders can also pose a serious threat to Heroes when they grow up to a hundred times their normal size.

# **SWARMS**

Even normal-sized animals can be dangerous, if they appear in sufficient numbers. A single rat wouldn’t worry most Heroes, but a couple of thousand of them can make a formidable obstacle. Vampires, it is said, can control rats and bats, and any place where there is sufficient food and enough peace and quiet – like a burial-place, for instance – can develop huge populations of scavenging beetles and the like.

Rats and bats are treated as hazards in the **Advanced Heroquest** rulebook. Here, they are treated as monsters, and can be fought normally using weapons or magic. In addition, the **Advanced Heroquest** rulebook lists a few special measures for dealing with rats and bats; these are amended slightly:

**Rat Poison** has no effect on a Swarm of rats. While they are fighting the Heroes, the rats are too busy to be interested in the poison.

**Greek Fire** can be used against Swarms of any kind. A flask can be thrown up to 3 squares, using the thrower’s **BS** to determine a hit. If the Greek Fire hits, each flask takes 2 _Wounds_ from the Swarm.

**Screech Bugs** will drive off a Swarm of bats. The Swarm moves directly away from the Hero holding the Screech Bug, and is removed from play as soon as it goes out of sight of the Heroes. At this point the Screech Bug must be discarded.

# **OTHER MONSTERS**

These were mostly inspired by the Citadel Miniatures’ C18 Night Horrors and CC1 Gothic Horror ranges, as shown here. The range also included miniatures for many of the Undead creatures that were covered in an earlier instalment.

### **Gorgon**

The Gorgon (sometimes called Medusa) is a terrible half-human monster, created by the forces of Chaos – a mixture of woman and snake. Some Gorgons are entirely human in appearance except for the fact that their hair is replaced by a mass or writhing snakes; others have snake bodies from the waist down. Gorgons are always female. Both types have one thing in common – they can turn a living creature to stone just by looking it in the eye. This ability makes them one of the most feared monsters in the world.

Human-bodied Gorgons are highly intelligent, and may use spells. Snake-bodied Gorgons do not have any magical ability, but often use long bows in addition to their gaze weapon.

**GORGON (HUMAN-BODIED)**

**GORGON (SNAKE-BODIED)**

### **Construct**

A Construct (sometimes called a Flesh Golem) is an artificial human being, often made by looting body parts from burials, stitching them together, and restoring the monster to life with electricity. Throughout the ages, scholars and doctors have been intrigued by the idea of creating artificial life, and some have been successful. The Construct is generally far less intelligent than a living person, but far stronger.

### **Witch**

Necromancers and Liches are not the only evil spellcasters who may be found in places of burial. Witches often loot graves for strange ingredients which they need for their brews and spells. Although they generally know less magic than Necromancers or Liches, they can still be dangerous. In the **Advanced Heroquest** rulebook, it is possible to meet a Non-Player Character Witch in some Hazard rooms; the Witch described here can be encountered anywhere, and is always hostile. Unlike the “Hazard” Witch, she will not run off with the Heroes’ money, and cannot scape by teleporting.

### **Evil Cultist**

Cultists are evil humans who conduct strange rituals to evil powers in the hope of becoming more powerful themselves. Places of burial are favourite locations for their rituals, and sometimes they will follow a powerful undead creature like a Vampire Lord or a Liche. The are slightly weaker than men-at-arms, and have no special abilities.

### **Sacrificial Victim**

A victim freed from a sacrificial altar might not be as strong as a Hero, but they will be very motivated to fight for their life and freedom!

### **Priest**

This profile could be used for an evil cult priest (with 2 Dark Wizard spells) or a good priest who may become an ally for the Heroes (with 2 Light Wizard spells).

# **NOTES AND SPECIAL RULES**

As you’ll have seen from the monster reference sheets, all undead creatures are _fearsome monsters_. Some of them have other special rules, which you’ll find explained in the **Advanced Heroquest** rulebook. There are also some brand new special rules, which you won’t have seen before. These are explained below.

### **Flying Creature**

A flying creature can fly over hazards like pits and chasms, and ignores death zones when moving. It is also harder to hit with ranged weapons – Heroes firing or throwing ranged weapons at this creature suffer a -1 penalty to hit.

### **Swarm**

A swarm is a mass of small creatures – literally thousands of them. A swarm exerts the same death zone as a large monster, and rolls three times as many damage dice as indicated by its Strength – this reflects its thousands of tiny claws and teeth. For every 2 Wounds it loses, however, the swarm loses 1 damage die.

### **Petrifying Gaze**

The Gorgon has a terrifying special ability – her gaze can turn a Hero into a stone statue! The only defence is to look away – and keep looking away. When a Gorgon is encountered, every Hero who can see her must make a test against _Speed_. Those who fail are too slow in looking away, and are turned to stone unless they expend a Fate Point. Heroes who are looking away cannot use ranged weapons against the Gorgon, and Heroes who are fighting her hand-to-hand must make a test against _Intelligence_ each round, before attacking. If the test is passed, the Hero keeps looking away, and suffers a -2 penalty to hit the Gorgon. If the test is failed, the Hero looks at the Gorgon, and is turned to stone unless he spends a Fate Point!
