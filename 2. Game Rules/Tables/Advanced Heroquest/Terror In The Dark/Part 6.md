The outtakes from _Advanced Heroquest Undead Supplement_ (published as _Terror in the Dark_) continue this week with the final two Quest Machine locations: Overrun Necropolis and Vampire’s Stronghold. Next weekend I’ll post a section on side-quests and the list of cardboard components that I submitted with the original manuscript.

As in previous instalments, the quests for these two locations include multiple references to _Warhammer_ lore. The city of Praag is well known from the _Kaleb Daark_ comic and later sources, but as far as I remember the Geroyograd cemetery is my own invention. Kreutzhofen and the Reichenbach family come from _Death’s Dark Shadow,_ a minor Flame Publications release developed by Carl Sargent from the old scenery pack _Blood on the Streets._ Sadly, this is no longer available. This was written before the Vampire Counts became part of _Warhammer_ lore, otherwise I would probably have named the Carstein family instead.

# **OVERRUN NECROPOLIS**

Two centuries ago, the forces of Chaos rampaged across the Old World. Although they were finally defeated and turned back into the Northern Wastes, there are some places which retain the mark of Chaos to this day. One such place is the doomed city of Praag, which was conquered and occupied by the forces of Chaos for over a year. To this day, the city has not been re-settled, and travellers who have passed by it return with horrifying tales. Just outside the city walls stands the great cemetery of Geroyograd. Here, the foul influence of Chaos has been no less than within the walls, and all manner of evil may be found here

### **Quests**

Roll once on the following table to discover why the Heroes are going into the Chaos-tainted cemetery:

| D12   | Quest            |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| 1-3   | The Emerald Tear |
| 4-6   | Bogatyr’s Sword  |
| 7-9   | The Raven Shrine |
| 10-12 | Rat’s Bane       | 


### **The Emerald Tear**

#### **Players’ Information**

Imperial Wizards have discovered the heart of Chaos within the cemetery. A huge chunk of Warpstone – primal Chaos in solid form – lies somewhere in the catacombs beneath the graveyard, and its influence is responsible for much of the evil that afflicts the place. Your Quest is to find the Warpstone and destroy it, using a ritual which the Imperial Wizards have taught you. But beware – Skaven have been seen in the area, and they too must be searching for the Warpstone…

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Undead Lairs_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Wandering Monsters Matrix_ from _The Quest for the Shattered Amulet_ in the **Advanced Heroquest** rulebook

Take a Clan Skryre Sorcerer Character Monster Counter to represent the leader of the Skaven expedition. The Clan Skryre Sorcerer may be added to any group of Skaven encountered on the Quest.

Each time the Heroes encounter a Quest room, roll a D12. On a roll of 1-9 it is actually a Hazard room, and the GM may take one Dungeon Counter. On a roll of 10-12, the Heroes have found the piece of Warpstone known as the Emerald Tear. To complete the Quest, a Wizard must spend an entire exploration turn in the room with the Warpstone reading the ritual to destroy it.

### **Bogatyr’s Sword**

#### **Players’ Information**

The great Hero Bogatyr fell in the defence of Praag as the forces of Chaos engulfed the land, and was one of the last people to be buried in the cemetery of Geroyograd before Praag was conquered. Now, the Tsar of Kislev has received a prophecy concerning Bogatyr’s sword – if it can be recovered by a true Hero and given back to the Tsar, then Praag may be reclaimed from Chaos at last. Your Quest is to find the sword of Bogatyr and take it to the Tsar.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

Quest rooms will always be stairs down. Each time the Heroes find a sarcophagus, you should roll a D12 – a roll of 12 or more means that they have found the tomb of Bogatyr. Add 1 for each sarcophagus they have already discovered, and 1 for each Fate Point they spend to increase their chances. Players must decide to spend Fate Points before the dice is rolled.

The sarcophagus contains only the sword and the bones of Bogatyr. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find the sword and take it out of the complex. The Sword of Bogatyr is a magical weapon – it does double damage against all creatures and followers of Chaos (Chaos Thugs, Chaos Warriors, Chaos Champions, Chaos Lords, Minotaurs, Beastmen, Bloodthirsters, Daemonettes, Greater Daemons of Tzeentch). The Heroes may use the sword while fighting their way out of the complex, but may not keep it after the Quest.

### **The Raven Shrine**

**[4]Players’ Information**

Somewhere in the cemetery is a shrine sacred to Morr, the guardian of the dead. If the shrine can be found, a short ritual conducted there will weaken the power of Chaos in Praag considerably. Your quest is to escort a priest into the cemetery, find the shrine, and protect him while he conducts the ritual.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Undead Lairs_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Undead Wandering Monsters_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Undead Wandering Monsters_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Chaos Sorcerer Followers_ table

A Priest Character Sheet is given elsewhere in this book. Each time the Heroes discover a Quest room, roll a D12: on a roll of 1-9 it is a set of stairs down, on a roll of 10 or more it is the shrine. Shrines found in Hazard rooms are lesser shrines, of no importance to this Quest. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must reach the shrine with the priest, who must then spend a full exploration turn there to complete his funeral ritual. After the ritual has been completed, all undead creatures encountered will have half their normal **W** score. A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so.

### **Rat’s Bane**

#### **Players’ Information**

A powerful Skaven Sorcerer is in the cemetery of Geroyograd, planning an unspeakable ritual which will strengthen the power of Chaos not only in Praag but throughout the Old World. You must go into this terrible place, find the Skaven before the ritual can be completed, and kill it if possible.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Wandering Monster Matrix_ from _The Quest for the Shattered Amulet_ in the **Advanced Heroquest** rulebook

Take a Clan Skryre Sorcerer Character Monster Counter to represent the Skaven. There are no Quest rooms in this Quest, so re-roll any Quest Room results on the _Room Type_ table. Each time the Heroes encounter Skaven (_before_ any combat takes place), roll a D12: on a roll of 10-12 the Sorcerer is with the encountered Skaven! To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find and destroy the Skaven Sorcerer.

# **VAMPIRE’S STRONGHOLD**

On the slopes of the Grey Mountains, near the border between The Empire and Bretonnia, stands the village of Kreutzhofen. It was once ruled by the von Reichenbach family, whose ruined mansion lies just outside the village shunned by all. It is said that a strong strain of vampirism ran through the Reichenbach bloodline; certainly their rule was tyrannical, which is why the locals rose up against them many years ago. Some say that the von Reichenbachs were not all wiped out, and that the evil Vladimir von Reichenbach – now a Vampire – haunts the extensive cellars and crypts beneath the ruined mansion…

### **Quests**

Roll once on the following table to discover why the Heroes are going into the ruined mansion:

| D12   | Quest              |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| 1-3   | Search and Destroy |
| 4-6   | No Resting Place   |
| 7-9   | Rescue             |
| 10-12 | The Monster        | 


### **Search and Destroy**

#### **Players’ Information**

Irrefutable proof has been found that a Vampire lurks beneath the Reichenbach mansion. Your Quest is to enter the complex, find the Vampire, and destroy him.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

Take a Vampire Lord Character Monster Counter to represent Vladimir von Reichenbach. Generate the complex normally, except that the first two Quest rooms will be stairs down. The third Quest room is the Vampire’s inner sanctum – unless the Heroes have previously met and destroyed him he will be here, along with minions generated by two rolls on the _Vampire Lord Followers_ table. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find and kill von Reichenbach.

### **No Resting Place**

#### **Players’ Information**

Vampires must rest in a coffin, and a powerful or clever Vampire normally keeps more than one. Your Quest is to enter the tunnels beneath the mansion, find as many coffins as you can, and destroy them all.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

Take a Vampire Lord Character Monster Counter to represent Vladimir von Reichenbach. Whenever the Heroes encounter a Quest room, roll a D12: on a roll of 1-9 the room contains an empty coffin, which may be destroyed by spending an exploration turn in the room with it. On a roll of 10-12 the Heroes have found a coffin which is currently occupied by von Reichenbach.

The room is guarded by minions generated by one roll on the _Vampire Lord Followers_ table, and on the second round of combat von Reichenbach will have awoken and left his coffin, able to attack or escape. Once the Heroes find and destroy the coffin that von Reichenbach actually occupies, the Quest is at an end.

### **Rescue**

#### **Players’ Information**

Somewhere deep within his lair, von Reichenbach is holding a prisoner – the daughter of a local nobleman. Unless she can be saved, she will surely perish – or worse. Your Quest is to find and rescue the princess – her father is offering a reward for her safe return.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Undead Lairs_ table until second Quest room found, then _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Undead Wandering Monsters_ table until second Quest room found, then _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

Take a Vampire Lord Character Monster Counter to represent von Reichenbach. At any time during the Quest, von Reichenbach may turn the princess into a Lesser Vampire by trading ten Dungeon counters (NOT including von Reichenbach’s Vampire Lord Character Monster Counter) for one Lesser Vampire Character Monster Counter.

Generate the complex normally, except that the first two Quest rooms will be stairs down. If you generate a Maiden encounter in a Hazard room, ignore it and fill the room with monsters generated by one roll on the _Vampire Lord Followers_ table instead. The third Quest room is the cell where the princess is imprisoned, if she has not been turned into a Vampire – use the Victim Character Sheet to represent her. If the princess becomes a Vampire before the Heroes find her, discard the Victim Character Sheet and play her as a Character Monster – the Heroes will be in for a nasty shock when they find her!

To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find the princess before she is turned into a Vampire, and escort her out of the complex. In addition to normal rewards, the princess’ father will pay the Heroes 100 GCs if she is rescued without being hurt, 20 GCs if she is rescued but wounded – and nothing at all if she is killed or turned into a Vampire, of course.

### **The Monster**

#### **Players’ Information**

Somewhere in the crypts and passages beneath the ruined von Reichenbach mansion, a madman is conducting experiments into the creation of artificial life. In a deserted secret laboratory far underground, local doctor Jakob Entesang has discovered the partially-completed creature, built from the remains of the dead by one of the von Reichenbach family. The villagers of Kreutzhofen have just become aware of what is happening – your Quest is to find the secret laboratory, confront the mad doctor, and put an end to his experiments once and for all. No easy task when they say that the cellars of the ruined mansion are haunted by ghosts, Vampires and worse…

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Undead Lairs_ table until second Quest room found, then _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Undead Wandering Monsters_ table until second Quest room found, then _Vampire Lore Followers_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Undead Wandering Monsters_ table until second Quest room found, then _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Vampire Lord Followers_ table

Take a Necromancer Character Monster Counter to represent Doctor Entesang. At any time during the Quest, the mad doctor may activate his monster by trading ten Dungeon counters (NOT including his own Character Monster Counter) for one Construct Character Monster Counter.

The first two Quest rooms will be stairs down. The third Quest room is the hidden laboratory – Entesang will be here, and so will the Construct unless it has already been activated. Entesang counts as a Sergeant. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find and destroy the Construct.
