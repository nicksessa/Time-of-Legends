Carrying on from two previous posts ([Fiction](https://graemedavis.wordpress.com/2024/11/02/advanced-heroquest-some-outtakes-i-found/) and [New Hazards](https://graemedavis.wordpress.com/2024/11/09/advanced-heroquest-new-hazards/)), here are some more outtakes from my manuscript for _Advanced Heroquest Undead Supplement,_ parts of which became _Terror in the Dark._ This time, it’s the undead monsters.

Only four undead creatures made their way into _Terror in the Dark:_ the Wight, Liche, Ghoul, and Vampire. You’ll find them here, too – with many others – because in a few cases, Carl Sargent made some changes while developing my manuscript. You can decide which versions you prefer.

Next week, I’ll post the section on Dark Wizards and their spells that is mentioned in the notes for some of the more powerful creatures. Until then, enjoy these horrors – and let me know what you think of them!

Before we get started, though, a note on the look of this post. WordPress isn’t the easiest when it comes to formatting tables, so I did the best I could – largely by creating the tables in Word and then pasting them in from screenshots. It’s not ideal, I know, and someone with greater skill could probably have made it look a lot better, but I’m hoping you’ll agree with me that it’s the information that really matters.

Anyway, enjoy!

# **UNDEAD**

The undead were once human, but something terrible happened to them when they died. Instead of finding rest, they are cursed to walk the earth, often in the service of evil Wizards. Next to the vile forces of Chaos, the undead are the most frightening monsters in the world.

### **Ghoul**

Like most undead, Ghouls were once human, but something went wrong when they were buried. Now, they haunt graveyards and other charnel places, feeding on the corpses of the dead – and if the living disturb them, they are not averse to live prey as well. A single Ghoul is not a very dangerous opponent, but a pack of them can be terrible indeed. Their filthy claws are poisonous, and their teeth are sharp and jagged.

### **Ghoul Chieftain**

### **Ghost**

A Ghost is the disembodied spirit of a dead person, which cannot find rest for some reason. The spirits of murder victims, and those who have not had a proper burial for any reason, often become Ghosts. A Ghost may follow and evil Wizard, doing his bidding in exchange for the promise of rest later on. Needless to say, these promises are seldom kept. Ghosts cannot attack physically, but their touch can rob even the greatest Hero of his courage, and send him screaming away.

### **Liche**

A Liche is an evil Wizard who has managed to cheat death. Although his body is dead and continues to decay around him, the Liche’s mind is preserved by his foul sorcery, and he lives on – if this can be called living – to do greater and greater evil. Liches generally shun the world of the living, and surround themselves with undead servants created by their evil magic.

### **Mummy**

Created by the mysterious enchantments of far-off Araby, a Mummy is a dead body wrapped in bandages and preserved for thousands of years. The chemical treatments that went into its making have hardened the Mummy’s skin and made it almost as tough as leather armour, while magic has been used to endow the Mummy with enough life to protect its tomb from tomb-robbers. Some evil Wizards make a practice of taking Mummies from their tombs and using them as magically-controlled servants and bodyguards.

### **Necromancer**

A Necromancer is not undead, but has many dealings with them. He is an evil Wizard who specialises in the undead, and in time – if he discovers the right enchantments – he may become a Liche. Necromancers seldom have any living friends or servants, but this doesn’t bother them – the undead are more loyal and obedient.

### **Skeleton**

The Skeleton is one of the weakest of the undead, and is simply a human skeleton animated by evil magic. Skeletons form the rank-and-file of most undead armies, and are the most common servants of Necromancers and other evil Wizards.

### **Skeleton Warrior**

### Skeleton Archer

### **Spectre**

Like the Ghost, the Spectre is the disembodied spirit of a dead person. A Spectre is trapped between worlds because of a curse, or as a result of breaking an oath in its lifetime. Many Spectres have existed for so long that they no longer remember their lives, and some develop an obsessive hatred for the living. Although they cannot attack physically, a Spectre’s touch sends a deathly chill through its victim, which can kill as surely as a blade.

### **Undead Champion**

The mortal remains of a Hero – or of a notorious evildoer – may be used by an evil Wizard to make a Skeleton warrior of better-than-average strength and skill. Undead Champions are sometimes placed in charge of undead troops by their masters.

### **Undead Warlord**

When a very great Hero dies – or a very great villain, for that matter – his remains may still carry some of the greatness he possessed in life, and a Necromancer or other evil Wizard may be able to create an Undead Warlord. These powerful warriors are the greatest of all Skeletons, and a deadly foe indeed – some are so powerful that they can become undead leaders in their own right, commanding armies of Skeletons and other undead creatures.

### **Vampire**

Vampires exist as the result of a curse or a tainted bloodline. Although dead, they look very much like living humans, until they open their mouths – then it is possible to see the fangs which they use to take blood from the living. An ancient and powerful Vampire Lord is a terrible foe, using magic in addition to his vampiric powers and followers. A lesser Vampire is more easily defeated, but still a deadly opponent.

### **Lesser Vampire**

### **Wight**

A Wight is another trapped spirit, like the Ghost and Spectre. It is held in the world of the living by an obsessive greed, jealously guarding the treasure with which it was buried. Misers who try to take their wealth with them will often become Wights, and they may also be found in ancient burial-mounds, which legends say may often hold great riches. Wights are more material than Ghosts, Wraiths and Spectres, and normally use weapons to defend their treasure.

### **Wraith**

Wraiths are among the most feared of the ethereal undead. Some are trapped in the world of the living by a life of great evil, and others by curses and evil magic. All Wraiths hate the living, and will attack them on sight. Like the Ghost and Spectre, a Wraith cannot attack physically, but its touch saps the life-energy from a victim, leaving him weak and sometimes draining life completely away.

### **Zombie**

A Zombie is very similar to a Skeleton, except that the flesh is still on the bones. Zombies are slower and a little less reliable than Skeletons, but some evil Wizards use them as guards and for other menial tasks.

## Monster Abilities

As you’ll have seen from the monster reference sheets, all undead creatures are _fearsome monsters_. Some of them have other special rules, which you’ll find explained in the **Advanced Heroquest** rulebook. There are also some brand new special rules, which you won’t have seen before. These are explained below.

### **Ethereal**

The Ghost, Spectre, Wight and Wraith are all _ethereal_, and some other monsters can become ethereal.

An ethereal creature isn’t solid, and can walk through walls, locked doors and other obstructions. It can also fly over hazards like pits and chasms. And because it isn’t solid, normal weapons simply pass right through it, causing no damage at all. Magical weapons and spells cause damage as normal.

Ethereal creatures can attack material beings (ie, anyone who isn’t ethereal!) in hand-to-hand combat as normal, but their attacks are always special – they can’t do normal damage because their blows pass right through a material target! These special attacks are explained elsewhere in this section.

A creature with the ability to become ethereal must spend a whole turn without moving or attacking anyone in order to do so. At the start of the next turn, it is ethereal. While it is ethereal, it cannot attack anyone in hand-to-hand combat – its blows pass right through them – but it may cast any spells it has in the usual way. Once the creature has become ethereal, it can become material again any time it wants, just by staying in the same spot for a full turn. At the start of the next turn, it is fully material.

### **Attack Causes Fear**

The Ghost cannot attack physically, since its blows would simply pass through a solid target. However, it has developed a special attack of its own, which in some ways is worse than any sword. Instead of drawing blood, its cold, misty claws suck out a man’s courage.

When a Ghost attacks, make hit and wound rolls as normal, but compare the damage dice to the target’s _Bravery_ instead of his _Toughness_. The target loses one _Bravery_ point for each dice that scores equal to or higher than his current _Bravery_. Lost _Bravery_ points are recovered in time for the next adventure.

### **Attack Causes Chill**

The Spectre is one of the most terrible of the ethereal undead, even though in its misty, non-material state it cannot land a blow on a living victim. But its hands can reach through a man’s armour and clothing, and stop his beating heart with their deathly coldness.

When a Spectre attacks, make hit and wound rolls normally, but do not take the target’s armour into account unless it is magical armour. For each dice that scores equal to or higher than the target’s _Toughness_, the target loses 1 **WS**, 1 **BS** and 1 **Sp** – but no Wounds. If any of these scores reaches zero, the Hero dies. Lost points are recovered in time for the next adventure.

### **Attack Causes Weakness**

Just as the Ghost drains a man’s courage and the Spectre steals his vitality, so the Wraith’s attack can rob even the mightiest Hero of his strength. Its spectral hands reach inside its victim’s body, and blight his muscles with the slackness of death.

When a Wraith attacks, make hit and wound rolls normally, but do not take the target’s armour into account unless it is magical armour. For each dice that scores equal to or higher than the target’s _Toughness_, the target loses 1 **S**, but no _Wounds_. If a Hero’s Strength score reaches zero, he dies. Lost points are recovered in time for the next adventure.
