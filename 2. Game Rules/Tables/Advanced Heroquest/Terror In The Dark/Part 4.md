The outtakes from _Advanced Heroquest Undead Supplement_ (published as _Terror in the Dark_) continue this week with two more locations from the quest generation system: Underground Battlefield and Dwarfhold Tomb Complex. Next weekend I’ll post the first two evil locations: Necromancer’s Lair and Evil City. [Here they are.](https://graemedavis.wordpress.com/2025/01/04/advanced-heroquest-the-quest-machine-part-5/)

As in previous instalments, the quests for these two locations include multiple references to _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay._ The Dwarf necromancer Sulring Durgul was created by Ken Rolston in _[Something Rotten in Kislev](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/237546/something-rotten-in-kislev-the-enemy-within-part-4?affiliate_id=314477),_ and the tombs of Kadar-Gravning feature in the Doomstones adventure [_Dwarf Wars_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/309219/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-doomstones-dwarf-wars?affiliate_id=314477) (the second part of _Wars and Death_ in the Hogshead reprint of the series). The mention of Durgul’s name here is nothing more than that, and I don’t think my intention was ever to tie the quests that mention him into the storyline of _Something Rotten in Kislev._

The Dwarfhold of Karak-Mordin seems to exist purely in this supplement. I think I made the name up, but it was intended to be a typical example of a World’s Edge Dwarfhold destroyed by Orcs.

One important note: A number of the quests here don’t use the conventional structure where the first two Quest Rooms are stairs down and the third is the quest objective. I experimented with some other structures, and a few of them could potentially drag on for a very long time. If you try any of them, let me know in the comments – and if you complete them, let me know how long it took you!

# **UNDERGROUND BATTLEFIELD**

On the eastern flank of the World’s Edge mountains, between the Old World of Humans and the Dark Lands of the Orcs, stands the ancient Dwarfhold of Karak-Mordin. When the Orcs overran the Dwarven realm many centuries ago, Karak-Mordin fell after a long siege, and its inhabitants were slaughtered. Hundreds of Orcs also fell in the battle, and the Dwarfhold has stood empty ever since. Empty, that is, except for various creatures that have taken up residence in the wrecked tunnels and chambers. The Dwarfs have spent centuries trying to locate and re-occupy all the Holds that were destroyed in the Orc Wars, but the task is immense. Dwarven scholars have only just rediscovered the location of Karak-Mordin, and the process of clearance and restoration is about to begin there.

### **Quests**

Roll once on the following table to discover why the Heroes are going into the Dwarfhold of Karak-Mordin:

| D12   | Quest             |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-2   | Stop the Renegade |
| 3-4   | The Iron Banner   |
| 5-6   | Dust to Dust      |
| 7-10  | Monster Hunt      |
| 11-12 | Ancient Knowledge | 


### **Stop the Renegade**

#### **Players’ Information**

The rebel Dwarf Wizard Sulring Durgul has found Karak-Mordin, and is preparing to raise a vast undead army there! You must find the evil Necromancer and thwart his plans – but hurry, for his power grows with each passing hour!

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Necromancer Followers_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Necromancer Followers_ table

Take a Necromancer Character Monster Counter to represent Sulring Durgul. Each time the Heroes encounter a Quest room, roll a D12. On a roll of 1-9 it is actually a Hazard room, and the GM may take one Dungeon Counter – time is getting shorter, and Durgul’s undead minions are growing more numerous! On a roll of 10-12, the Heroes have found Durgul’s lair – he is here (unless he has previously been encountered and killed) with one roll of minions from the _Necromancer Followers_ table. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must meet and kill Sulring Durgul.

### **The Iron Banner**

#### **Players’ Information**

The defenders of Karak-Mordin made their last stand in the royal tombs far beneath the Dwarfhold. Beneath the Iron Banner of King Brondi, the last survivors of the Orc invasion fought to the death. You must find the site of the last stand and retrieve the Iron Banner, so it can be returned to the Dwarven capital of Caraz-a-Carak and hung in a place of honour. You may not loot any tombs while on this Quest.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Disturbed_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

Each time the Heroes discover a Quest room, roll a D12: on a roll of 1-9 it is a set of stairs down, on a roll of 10 or more it is the entrance e to the royal tombs – the next Quest room will be the site of the defenders’ last stand. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must reach this room, and one or more of them must leave the complex carrying the banner.

A Hero who is carrying the banner is Fearsome to Orcs and Goblins, and to creatures and followers of Chaos. A Hero who is carrying the banner may not cast spells or use a bow, two- handed weapon or halberd – one hand must always be free to hold the banner.

A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so. The Heroes may not keep the Iron Banner after the Quest.

### **Dust to Dust**

#### **Players’ Information**

The dead of Karak-Mordin cry out for decent burial, and the Dwarven nation has hired the Heroes to escort one of their priests into the Dwarfhold to lay to rest the spirits of the dead. The priest must reach the central shrine of the Dwarfhold and conduct a ceremony there so that the spirits of the dead can rest in peace. You may not loot any tombs on this Quest.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

A Priest Character Sheet is given elsewhere in this book. Each time the Heroes discover a Quest room, roll a D12: on a roll of 1-9 it is a set of stairs down, on a roll of 10 or more it is the shrine.

To complete the Quest, the Heroes must reach this room with the Dwarf-priest, who must then spend a full exploration turn there to complete his funeral ritual. After the ritual has been completed, no Ethereal creatures will be encountered – ignore any encounters with Ghosts, Spectres, Wights and Wraiths, as nothing has happened! A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so.

### **Monster Hunt**

#### **Players’ Information**

The first stage in restoring Karak-Mordin is to clear out the monsters that have infested it since the Orcs came. Then the Dwarfs can restore and re-occupy the Hold.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

All Quest rooms will be stairs down. There are no stairs out (other than those the Heroes came in by), so replace this result on the _Passage End_ table with Dead End. The Quest ends when the Heroes have completely cleared the complex of monsters – when every passage has been followed to a dead end and no more doors remain to be opened. This may take some time! There is no Quest room on the third level – re-roll this result if it is generated by the _Room Type_ table.

### **Ancient Knowledge**

#### **Players’ Information**

Deep in the heart of Karak-Mordin is its great Library, containing the lost chronicles of the Dwarfhold and other documents which are of immense value to Dwarven scholars. Your Quest is to find the Library of Karak-Mordin, and bring back the lost chronicles.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

Each time the Heroes encounter a Quest room, roll a D12. On a roll of 1-9 it is actually a Hazard room, and on a roll of 10-12, the Heroes have found the Library. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must spend a full exploration turn in the Library.

# **DWARFHOLD TOMB COMPLEX**

Before the Orcs overran the Yetzin Valley a century ago, the area was ruled from Kadar-Gravning, a great and powerful Dwarfhold. Wrecked by the Orcs, Kadar-Gravning has been found and cleared, and the process of reconstruction has begun. It was no ordinary Dwarfhold, for in the royal tombs here was buried the great Dwarf-King Hargrim, whose crown is still a powerful symbol of leadership among the Dwarfs.

**[3]Quests**

Roll once on the following table to discover why the Heroes are going into the tombs of Kadar-Gravning:

| D12   | Quest               |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| 1-3   | Hargrim’s Crown     |
| 4-6   | Ghoul Hunt          |
| 7-10  | Dust to Dust        |
| 11-12 | Forbidden Knowledge | 


### **Hargrim’s Crown**

#### **Players’ Information**

The crown of the great Dwarf-King Hargrim is said to have been buried with him. Centuries later, the Dwarven realm is on the verge of civil war, with both sides claiming descent from Hargrim. His crown is still a potent symbol of leadership in Dwarven eyes, and if either side can recover it from his tomb, they will have an enormous political advantage.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Undead Lairs_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table, but re-roll Skaven, Orcs, Goblins and Chaos Thugs on the _Opposition_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Opposition_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Opposition_ table

The first two Quest rooms the Heroes encounter will be stairs down; the third will be Hargrim’s tomb. The Tomb is a small room with one door; the sarcophagus is in the centre. The Crown is resting on the sarcophagus. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find Hargrim’s Tomb and at least one of them must leave the complex with the Crown. They may not keep the Crown after the Quest. Heroes who search any sarcophagus lose a Fate Point each time they do so – a just punishment for their sacrilege!

### **Ghoul Hunt**

#### **Players’ Information**

The royal tombs have become infested by a nest of Ghouls! You must drive them out so that the eternal peace of the dead kings can be restored. Go into the tombs, kill every Ghoul you find, and discover their lair. You can claim a bounty of 10 GCs for each Ghoul you slay while on this Quest.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Ghoul_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Ghoul_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Ghoul_ table

The first and second Quest rooms encountered will both be stairs down to a deeper level; the third will be their lair, containing a Ghoul Chieftain and a number of Ghouls indicated by one roll on the _Ghoul_ table. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must find and slay the Ghoul Chieftain.

### **Forbidden Knowledge**

#### **Players’ Information**

Hidden in the royal tombs are many secret things. A renegade Dwarf Necromancer named Sulring Durgul has heard about these hiding-places, and has gone into The royal tombs to try to find them. There are things in The royal tombs that could make him terrifyingly powerful – you must follow him and stop him.

#### **GM’s Information**

**Lair Occupants:** _Undead Lairs_ table

**Wandering Monsters:** _Undead Wandering Monsters_  table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Necromancer Followers_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** _Necromancer Followers_ table

Take a Necromancer Character Monster Counter to represent Durgul.

Each time the Heroes encounter a Quest room, roll a D12. On a roll of 1-9 it is actually a Hazard room, and the GM may take one Dungeon Counter – time is getting shorter, and Durgul’s undead minions are growing more numerous! On a roll of 10-12, the Heroes have found Durgul’s  lair – he is here (unless he has previously been encountered and killed) with one roll of minions from the _Necromancer Followers_ table.

Each time you draw a Dungeon Counter, roll once on the _Magic Treasure_ table and give the resulting item to Durgul. He can’t use weapons and armour, though, so these are discarded. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must meet and kill Durgul. They may not keep any of the magical items he has when they find him, but they may keep anything else they find during the Quest. A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so.

### **Dust to Dust**

#### **Players’ Information**

The dead of Kadar-Gravning are restless because of the slaughter and destruction that the Orcs wrought there, and the Dwarven nation has hired the Heroes to escort one of their priests into the Dwarfhold to lay to rest the spirits of the dead. The priest must reach the central shrine of the tomb complex, and conduct a ceremony there so that the spirits of the dead can rest in peace. You may not loot any tombs on this Quest.

**Wandering Monsters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**Wandering Monster Dungeon Counters:** _Disturbed Complex_ table

**If referred to a _Followers_ table:** re-roll

A Priest character sheet is given elsewhere in this book. Each time the Heroes discover a Quest room, roll a D12: on a roll of 1-9 it is a set of stairs down, on a roll of 10 or more it is the shrine. To complete the Quest, the Heroes must reach this room with the Dwarf-priest, who must then spend a full game turn uninterrupted to complete his funeral ritual. A Hero who searches a sarcophagus during this Quest loses a Fate Point each time he does so.
