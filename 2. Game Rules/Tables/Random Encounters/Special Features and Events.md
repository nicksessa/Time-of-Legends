| Dread Portal: The party may pass through the Dread Portal and end up in any mapped room/corridor they wish. However each and every time the party chooses to pass through it, roll a D6 for each member. On a '1' they are lost in the portal. From now on, each time you enter a new area, immediately roll a D6 for each lost party member. On a '6' they reappear at your current location. You may opt to stay in an area and wait for them to reappear; test for Wandering Monsters each time you roll. If you leave the dungeon, or all party members become lost in the portal, anyone lost is lost forever. The portal may be used any number of times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Crypt: you may leave the crypt alone, or search it. On a 1-3 you awaken the dead – fight D6+2 skeletons (see Vermin Table). The skeletons have surprise and attack first.  Skeletons or no, you find 2D6x10 gold pieces                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Control Room: The traps of this dungeon are maintained from here. You may try to figure out the mechanisms by rolling against a d6+1 puzzle. For every failed attempt, test for wandering monsters on a 1-2. Wizards and rogues add their level to their puzzle-solving roll. If the puzzle is solved, reduce the Level of all traps encountered from now on by 1.

Further fountains have no effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Blessed Temple: A character of your choice gains a +1 on Attack against undead monsters or demons. As soon as the character kills at least one undead or demon, the bonus is gone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Armory: All characters can change their weapons if they want, within the limits of the weapons allowed to their character type. For example, a Warrior who was using a sword and shield may discard his shield and take a two-handed weapon, or exchange his sword for a mace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Cursed Altar: As you enter the room, an eerie glow emanates from a sinister altar. A random character is cursed and has now -1 on his Defense rolls. To break the curse, the character must either slay a boss monster alone, or enter a Blessed Temple (see 2, above), or have a Blessing spell cast on himself by a cleric.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Statue: you may leave the statue alone or touch it. If you touch it, roll d6. On a 1–3, the statue awakens and attacks your party (level 4 boss with 6 life points, immune to all spells; if you defeat it, you find 3d6 x 10 gold pieces inside). On a 4-6, the statue breaks, and you find 3d6 x 10 gold pieces inside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Puzzle Room: the room contains a puzzle box. Its level is d6. You may leave it alone or try to solve it. For every failed attempt, the character trying to solve it loses 1 life. Wizards and rogues add their level to their puzzle-solving roll. If the puzzle is solved, the box opens: make a Treasure roll to determine its contents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Enchanted Banquet. A sumptuously laid table is the room. You may eat and drink, or leave it alone. If you eat, roll on the Enchanted Banquet table for every character who ate. Decide if you eat before reading the possible outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Lava River. A random magic item is protected by a lava river crossing the room and flowing from East to West. If a character wants to leap over the river, he must roll versus a level 6 difficulty. Add +1 if the character is a halfling or an elf, subtract -1 if the character is a dwarf or wears heavy armor. A rogue adds +L. On a success, the character leaps on the other side and may take a random item from the Abyss magic treasure table. Once the character has taken the object, he must roll again to jump back on the other side. Failing the roll means the character takes 1d6 wounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Chained Monster. The room is a prison. A random Abyss boss is trapped here. The party may leave him alone, kill him (gaining no XP rolls or treasure for this cowardly act) or set him free.

However, when you meet the final boss, there is a 2 in 6 chance that the monster you set free will be with him in the room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Roll 1D6 1 lose 1 strength permanently, 2 lose 1 toughness permanently, 3+ lose wounds equal to your level permanently.  <br/>3-4 the sarcophagus is empty, but a screeching alarm goes off. Draw another event card immediately.  <br/>5 contains precious stones worth D6x200 gold per level.  <br/>6 treasure! The warrior gets a treasure item that does not count towards his share in this adventure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Book of Secrets. You find a book hidden under a loose stone. You may leave it alone or decide to pick it up and read it. A character of your choice can read the book and gain d6 Clues. However, the character reading the book must save vs the number of Clues +2 or gain d3 Madness points. Wizards add ½ L to this save roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Secret Stairs. The room contains a secret passage to a room or corridor of your choice on the upper level of the dungeon. This may not be the first room (the entrance) to the dungeon, or any room or section of corridor adjacent to that. If you decide to take the stairs, roll a 1 in 6 chance of meeting a wandering monster there. If you are playing an Abyss dungeon without an upper level, the secret stairs lead to a random room or corridor with no exits. Roll for content of this room twice and choose your preferred result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Trap! - Roll on the traps table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Mana Sink. All spellcasters must save versus a power 7 mana sink or lose their spells. Roll once per spell. On a success, the spell is not lost. Spells on scrolls and magic items are unaffected. Characters add +½ level. If the party moves through the room with mana sink again, do not apply the effect a second time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Flames Of Khazla. As soon as the last warrior enters the room stone shutters slam down on all entrances, forming airtight seals and blocking you in. Two braziers slide out of the wall, burning with no apparent fuel. <br/><br/>Any dwarf or wizard recognizes this as a trial by ordeal: the accused has to place their hands in the braziers and remain unburned. If not the shutters remained shut for 3 days and nights, whereupon they will suffocate from lack of fresh air. <br/>To open the shutters a warrior has to place their hands in the braziers and roll 1D6 per hand. If both score three or more the shutters open.  <br/><br/>If either die scores a 1 or 2 the warrior loses D6 wounds plus level with no modifiers. <br/>If both score a 1 or 2 the warrior loses 4D6 wounds plus level with no modifiers.  If any damage is taken the shutters stay down, if no warriors pass the test then all warriors die. <br/><br/>The test may only be tried once for each warrior, better have some luck handy!                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Footprints. You spot some footprints on the dusty stone floor that lead to a blank section of wall and vanish... <br/><br/>if the warriors investigate roll 1D6 <br/><br/>1 each warrior rolls 1D6 the lowest scorer shows that warrior is hit in the head by a spiked metal ball on a chain. He takes 2D6 wounds per rank, ignoring armor except a helmet. If more than 1 warrior rolled the same low number each of them are hit.  <br/><br/>2 the warriors find nothing. Any skill that finds secret doors can be used here instead of the normal rules with a +1 to the die roll. If successful this becomes a 3-6 roll instead. <br/><br/>3-6 the warriors find a concealed door, opening it reveals another part of the dungeon. Take 1D6 dungeon cards and a spare objective room card, which will be at the bottom of this new pile. If the warriors explore this objective room roll twice on the objective room monster table. If the warriors kill all the monsters they gain an additional 1000 gold on top of normal gold and objective room treasure.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Secret Door. Your sharp eyes notice that the stones in the wall conceal a secret door take a random objective room tile and place it where the secret door is. The warriors can choose to investigate or not. If not they just continue as normal. If they do investigate then roll on objective room monster table as normal. After the fight one random warrior finds an objective room treasure item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Runes. You notice dozens of runes covering a portion of the wall in this room.  Each warrior must roll 1D6 and one of them needs to score a 5+ to decipher the runes. If this is failed nothing else occurs.  If passed the warriors open a secret compartment and treasure pours out: each warrior gains an item of dungeon room treasure, re-rolling gold.  As the warriors take the treasure monsters pour down the corridors roaring for their blood! Roll twice on the warriors level monster table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Unholy Idol. In a niche in the wall is a small ferocious looking golden statue. It appears to be very old and of an unfamiliar deity. <br/><br/>One warrior determined randomly takes the idol. Roll 1D6  <br/><br/>1-2 the statue is cursed and as the warrior touches the idol a harsh bellowing is heard. The warrior loses one luck for the rest of this adventure, if the warrior has no luck left he loses 2 permanent wounds. The idol is back in it's niche.  <br/>3-4 as the statue is moved a faint roar can be heard, the warrior appears to be being thrashed by an invisible force. He suffers D6 wounds per rank plus level with no modifiers. Then idol is back in it's niche.  <br/>5-6 the idol is solid gold and worth 500 gold per rank. Until the end of the adventure monsters will attack this warrior preferentially, ignoring rules of one on one. If the warrior drops to zero wounds at any time when he is healed up again the idol is gone, back to this niche.  <br/><br/>Roll 1D6 on a 1-3 draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Evil Eye. The ceiling of this room is engraved with an evil face, which shoots bolts of magical energy at the warriors.  Each player rolls 1D4 and if they roll their own place in the initiative order they manage to avoid the blasts. If not they lose D3 wounds per level with no modifiers.  <br/><br/>Roll 1D6 on a 1-3 draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Map. Wedged between two large stones in the wall is a faded map.  Roll 1D6 when the map is taken.  <br/><br/>1 the map is a clever trap, it seems to show the location of a treasure hoard. The warriors of course fall for this! The next time an event card is drawn, or if the objective room is entered, the trap is sprung! Draw additional event cards equal to D3 + rank.  <br/>2 the map misleads the warriors. Add D3+rank dungeon cards to the top of the deck.  <br/>3-4 it is a map of the next room in this dungeon, showing hidden treasure. After dealing with the monsters/event in the room an extra item of treasure is found and all warriors can roll for gold too.  <br/>5 the map shows a quick route to civilization from this dungeon. The journey is two weeks shorter than normal.  <br/>6 although badly faded it could be useful, the next T junction you come to you can use the map to look at the top D3 cards in either direction. Then discard this map.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Sliding Wall. As the warriors enter, the wall behind them starts to grind across the doorway, blocking off the route out of the dungeon.  Unless one of the warriors discards a weapon or door spike to wedge the sliding door in place this part of the dungeon is sealed. Just as if a cave in had occurred.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Snake Pit. The floor of the room is covered with snakes, coiling about your legs and hissing loudly. Unless you tread carefully you may be bitten.  For each square over 1 that a warrior meets each turn roll a D6. On a roll of a 1 they are bitten by an angry snake and suffer 1 wound per rank with no modifiers. The snakes are poisonous as per the poison rules.  Any monsters are used to the snakes and suffer no penalties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Malediction. The walls of this part of the dungeon are covered in runes and other curses.  <br/><br/>Each warrior must roll 2D6 and add their strength and toughness. If they score 13+rank they are unaffected. Otherwise they must each roll 1D6 on the following table.  <br/><br/>1 the shapes and symbols glimmer as the warrior looks at them, then suddenly they are covering his skin too! The warrior is now marked for death, when monsters are placed they will always attack this warrior ignoring usual rules for one on one. This lasts for this adventure.  <br/>2 the warrior loses 1D3 wounds per rank with no modifiers.  <br/>3 the warrior feels a sharp pain and is at -1 toughness per rank while in this room.  <br/>4 the warrior becomes obsessed with the runes and has their initiative reduced by their rank for the rest of the adventure.  <br/>5 as long as the warrior is in this room he loses 1 wound per rank in the power phase every turn as old wounds re-open.  <br/>6 you utter a prayer to your deity and are rewarded! You regain all luck used so far this adventure and also gain an additional luck to use in this dungeon only.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately. |
| Room of Healing. Suddenly you feel a great warmth flow over you and wounds seem to heal of their own accord.  <br/><br/>This room is infused with healing magics and every model regains 1D6 wounds per rank in the power phase. Any monsters generated in this room are automatically at the maximum number as this is used as a gathering point for them.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Blessed Shrine. You come across an ancient shrine, no idea who left it here, but it has not yet been desecrated by the fell forces down here. You feel a great peace descend upon you and strength returns to weary limbs.  <br/><br/>As long as no monsters are in this room the warriors may pray at this shrine, this takes the entire warriors turn and they regain all of their missing wounds. In addition roll 1D6 and on a 6 they gain a permanent wound too.  <br/><br/>If monsters are on the board the warriors need to slay them swiftly as they are despoiling this shrine! They need to kill all the monsters within D3+1 turns or they lose all luck for the rest of the adventure. While they are trying to defeat them they do gain extra attacks equal to their rank though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Bookcase. Against the wall leans a bookcase, covered with aged tomes which are strangely not damaged by the pervasive damp down here.  <br/><br/>If the warriors ignore the bookcase then nothing else occurs. If however they decide to search the bookcase roll 1D6 to see what happens.  <br/><br/>1 this bookcase belongs to a fell sorcerer who promptly turns up: randomize one of the spell casting monsters of the appropriate level and place him and his guards on the board. They get an ambush as the warriors are busy searching.  <br/>2 the bookcase is a trap and vanishes, roll on the traps table.  <br/>3-4 actually these books are pretty ruined and you find nothing  <br/>5 a cloaked figure steps out of the darkness behind you “my books” it hisses and darkness sweeps over you all. It clears moments later and the bookcase has gone.  <br/>6 each warrior finds a magic item, roll on the table.  <br/><br/>Roll 1D6 on a 1-3 draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Elevator Room, Going Down. You've just entered this room and suddenly the floor shakes and the room descends due to some mechanical contrivance.  <br/><br/>There is no way to get the floor to go back and the rest of the adventure is deeper than anticipated in the bowels of the earth: any further monsters are rolled on the tables one level higher than the warriors level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Elevator Room, Going Up. You've just entered this room and suddenly the floor shakes and the room ascends in due to some mechanical contrivance. <br/><br/>There is no way for the warriors to get the room to descend, the rest of the dungeon is treated as being one level lower (easier).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Horned Rat Shrine. In the corner of this room is a shrine to the horned rat, surrounded by offerings left by the vile skaven.  <br/><br/>This room is protected by magics and warpstone which will attack any warrior who attempts to rob the shrine. The shrine is surrounded by 3D6 x50 gold per level of the warriors and an item of dungeon room treasure per warrior too.  <br/><br/>If this is left alone the warriors have nothing to fear, if they try to take the offerings roll 1D6  <br/><br/>1 warpfire explosion: each warrior takes 1D6 damage per rank with no modifiers. In addition roll 1D6 for every magic item and on a 1 it is destroyed.  <br/>2-3 warpstone twist: the warpstone mutates the warriors roll on the chaos attributes table. This lasts until the end of the adventure. Roll a D6 then and on a 1 it is permanent.  <br/>4-5 monsters attack: roll twice on the monster table  <br/>6 old curse: the curses and other defenses are old and have aged, the warriors lose wounds equal to their level with no modifiers but are otherwise free to pillage this shrine!                                                                                                                      |
| Shaky Floor. The floor in here is uneven and wobbles too, making the floor very hard to balance on.  <br/><br/>Warriors move at half speed while in this room, rounding down, they must also pass a pinning roll before they can move at all. Monsters are used to this room and do not suffer these penalties.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Sacrificial Altar.  A stone slab lies in this room which is covered with blood from many sacrificial victims.  <br/><br/>The magical energies in this room cause the following effects on warriors, roll 1D6.  <br/><br/>1 each warrior has -1 to hit while in this room.  <br/>2 each warrior suffers -2 to strength and toughness while in this room.  <br/>3-4 the warriors are unnerved by the altar and suffer -1 to hit for one round of combat only while in this room.  <br/>5 the warriors are enraged by the sight and gain +1 attack but -1 to hit while in this room.  <br/>6 the rage the warriors feel at the sight of this altar grants them all +1 attack and strength while in this room. <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Illusory Wall. You notice that dust falling from the ceiling is passing through a section of wall and realize that it is an illusion covering a hidden doorway.  <br/><br/>Exploring beyond the doorway reveals an extra objective room, chosen at random from those that are spare. If the warriors investigate roll 1D6  <br/><br/>1 heavily trapped room: roll 3 traps and resolve those and other events that occur and then roll once on the monster table to see what attacks them. No treasure beyond gold is earned.  <br/>2 traps and dust. Roll on the traps table twice but no other event cards are taken and no monsters appear. This room has long been abandoned.  <br/>3-4 yes this is a room all right. Nothing is here though.  <br/>5 draw an event card as normal for a room there is also gold, roll as per the rules after event dealt with.  <br/>6 unguarded gold chamber: roll for gold as normal there are no further events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Mirrors. You notice there are mirrors covering the walls in this chamber. Your reflections are acting slightly differently to you though, sometimes offering you an item in their hands, other times seeming ready to attack.  <br/><br/>The warriors can attempt to interact with the mirrors or ignore them and continue. If they ignore them this event does nothing. Otherwise roll 1D6 for each warrior.  <br/><br/>1 a duplicate of you steps from the mirror and attacks you!  <br/>2 the mirror-you strikes through the mirror and automatically hits, calculate damage normally.  <br/>3-4 yes, that is a mirror alright. Maybe the movements were a trick of the light? Roll again next turn  <br/>5 the mirror-you hands over a pouch containing gold, you gain 2D6x10gold per level  <br/>6 the mirror-you hands over an item of treasure roll on treasure table as normal re-roll gold.  <br/><br/>If a duplicate leaves the mirror it only attacks the warrior it resembles. It has the same weapons and skills, but only uses skills that are always on and cannot cast spells. In addition every power phase that the duplicate is active monsters arrive to investigate the noise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Rockfall. All characters must make a dodge save vs level 4 to avoid the rocks or lose 1 life.

| Lost! The party becomes disorientated. The lantern-bearer must make a save vs a level of 1 + the number of passages and or doors that lead into the current area. If they fail the party becomes lost, and their next move is determined randomly (it may take them back to an area they've already passed through). Make the same save in each area; the party moves randomly each turn until the save is made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| A ghost passes through the party. All characters must save versus level 4 fear or lose 1 life. A cleric adds his level to this roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| You meet a wandering alchemist. He will sell you up to one potion of healing per party member (50 gold pieces each) or a single dose of blade poison (30 gold pieces). The potion of healing will heal all lost life points to a single character, and can be swallowed at any moment during the game as a free action. The blade poison lets you envenom a single arrow or slashing weapon (not a crushing weapon). That weapon will have a +1 on Attack against the first enemy you fight. Poison will not work on undead monsters, demons, blobs, automatons, or living statues. <br/><br/>You can meet a wandering alchemist only once per game. If you meet him again, treat this result as a trap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

If you do not do this, the ghost will curse you, and all characters will be at -1 on their Defense rolls until a Blessing spell is cast on them (one spell per person is required).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Dead Body. Lying in a pool of blood, you find the body of an adventurer. Clutched tightly to his chest is a bag. One randomly determined warrior gets the bag from the body. Roll 1D6 <br/><br/>1 roll twice on the traps table, the bag is empty 2-3 roll once on the traps table, the bag is empty 4-6 treasure: the bag contains D6x100 gold per level of the warrior, the taker gets this gold. <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Dying Dwarf. Slumped against the wall you find a dying dwarf prospector, riddled with arrows. As you approach he growls a warning, threatening you with a huge pick axe. When he realizes you are not evil monsters trying to kill him he calms down long enough to hand you a key. “This is the key to the portcullis.” Then he dies from his injuries. <br/><br/> The dwarf may have wandered far and the key fits the next portcullis the warriors find themselves faced with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Lone Mercenary. A lone mercenary, still wounded from a previous clash with monsters, lets you know some of what lies ahead. You may take the next three cards from the dungeon deck and re-order them as you like.  <br/><br/>Roll 1D6 and on a 1-3 draw another event card immediately. <br/><br/>If not using tiles, you can instead roll twice on the next three rooms and chose the result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Sneaky Git. A snotling runs out of the darkness and starts to tag along, hoping to steal some treasure. He is a shifty little guy and every time you enter a room he squeaks a warning, but who too? While the snotling is with the warriors they all gain +1 move as he guides them through the underground complex. In addition whenever an event reveals monsters roll 1D6 <br/><br/>1-3 the snotling warns the monsters of the warriors and they automatically surprise the warriors.<br/>4-6 the snotling warns the warriors and they gain surprise and also get +1 Attack in the first round of combat. <br/><br/>If the warriors kill the snotling his blood curdling death scream echoes through the dungeon attracting monsters. Roll twice on the monster table one level higher than the warriors, these monsters show up and fight. Roll 2D6 at the end of each turn, on a double one or two the snotling leaves the warriors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Stranger. You meet a mysterious cloaked stranger who asks what your business is in this dark realm. <br/><br/> If the warriors attack him roll 1D6 <br/><br/>1-3 like a blur of lightning he fends the warriors off, causing 2D6 wounds on each warrior per rank, then he leaps over their heads and vanishes back into the darkness. <br/> 4-6 under the combined might of the warriors attacks he falls back, then flees into the darkness.

| Gold Digger. You meet an aged dwarf laboring under the weight of a huge sack. He eyes you suspiciously, seemingly convinced you want to steal it's contents, and tells you that he is the lord of this dungeon and you have to pay him to pass any further within his halls, his fee is 100 gold (per level). <br/><br/>The only way to get past him is to pay him the 100 gold (per level), kill him or find another way if you have passed a T junction for example. If the warriors pay him he simply takes the money and continues his way.  If they kill him he curses them with his dying breath, each warrior must roll a D6  <br/><br/>1 choose two characteristics and you permanently reduce it by -1.  <br/>2 as above but only one characteristic is reduced by -1.  <br/>3-6 the curses have no effect. In any event his bag is full of rocks.  <br/><br/>Roll 1D6 on a 1-3 draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Nurgle's Rot. You are confronted by a cowled figure, crawling towards you crying out for help. Roll 1D6 for each warrior, the one with the lowest score goes to his rescue. If more than one has the lowest all of the lowest rollers go. <br/><br/>Upon reaching him you recognize the signs of Nurgle's rot and your approach was probably not the best idea!  Roll 1D6 and add your toughness to the result, if you get 6+your rank then you are unaffected.  If you roll lower then you have contracted the dreaded Nurgle's rot.  You immediately suffer -1 penalty to your toughness. Every time an unexpected event occurs you suffer another -1 to any of your other characteristics, not including wounds. If any of your characteristics reach zero (or 7+ in the case of BS) then your warrior dies. <br/><br/> The Nurgle's rot continues until you die, is given 3 healing potions per rank without regaining any wounds from them (they have to be consumed when on full wounds and all at the same time) or until you get to a settlement and pay 2000 gold per level to be cured.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The warrior can do nothing else this turn but next turn they get +1 on this table. <br/>3-4 the snakes bit you, causing 1D6 wounds per rank with no modifiers, you then cut yourself clear of them and are not affected by them any more.  <br/>5-6 as the snakes pour from the ceiling you nimble dodge to one side, the attack has no effect. <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Locked Door. The next door the warriors find is locked.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Portcullis. Once all the warriors have entered this room a portcullis slams down blocking the way back out.  If this occurs as a result of an unexpected event then it does not split the party. <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Lost. After wandering around the dungeon for what seems like hours you finally concede that you are lost. Get the spare dungeon cards out, avoiding the objective room cards. Roll D3+ rank and add that many dungeon cards to the deck.  If this happens when you're already in the objective room then re-roll the event.  <br/><br/>If not using tiles, simply add 1d3 +1 more rooms to the dungeon.        |
| Slaves. You come across some slaves chained to the walls of this room/passage, they cry out for rescue and clearly have not been looked after well.  <br/><br/>There is no reward for freeing the slaves, but compassion demands their freedom! It takes 1D6+rank turns to free the slaves, during this time Unexpected Events occur on a roll of 1 or 2 in the monster phase.  <br/><br/>If the warriors decide not to free the slaves this must be noted and a D6 must be rolled whenever they attempt to advance a level. <br/>1-3 the owner of the training ground recognizes the warrior by a description given by one of the escaped slaves who died shortly after escaping. They refuse to train your warrior and you cannot advance in level in this settlement. <br/>4-5 you are recognized as above but the trainer will train you for double the normal price. <br/>6 you are not recognized and can train as normal.  <br/><br/>This table will always be rolled on and is also used for any other failed quest reasons related to turning back, except for having to escape as per escaping rules.              |
| Dying Orc. You find a badly wounded orc lying on the floor, even though dying from a dozen wounds he growls at you swinging a scimitar in your general direction. He has what appears to be a key in his other hand.  <br/><br/>The warriors can either rush him or wait for him to die, he is blocking the way so they cannot simply continue through the dungeon. <br/><br/>If they rush him he lashes out desperately even as he dies. Roll 1D6 for each warrior, on a 1,2 or 3 they are struck for 1D6 wounds per rank +2 damage, modified as normal. This ends with the orc's death and they get the object. <br/><br/>If they wait for him to die it takes 1D6 +1 per rank turns, during which time he makes a lot of noise, if an unexpected event occurs during this time take no event cards just roll two monster rolls on the warriors level table.  <br/><br/>The orc was holding the key to event 24 (the locked door).         |
| Change of Plan. A cloaked, stooped figure slinks into view, keeping to the shadows and moving with an eerie silence. He furtively approaches you and, while looking around theatrically about him for enemies, says in little more than a whisper  “Well met my friends. I bring important news. Your quest must be abandoned for the danger is must greater than any imagined. You must return the way you came where you will be met and rewarded with 750 gold(per level) for your trouble.”  With that he slinks away into the darkness merging with the shadows once more.  <br/><br/>If the warriors decide to leave the dungeon they must retrace their steps, rolling for Unexpected Events as normal until they exit the entrance.<br/><br/> If there is something blocking the exit they'll just have to continue.  <br/><br/>If they continue onwards then you don't need to do anything until the objective room is entered.  <br/><br/>Whatever they decide roll 1D6 when they reach their goal (objective room or entrance)<br/><br/>1-2 the character lied and the warriors were not expected back, if they left then it is too late to finish the quest now. Whenever the warriors try to advance a level they need to roll on the table for event 29 with a +1 bonus.  If the warriors ignored the warnings and continued then the adventure is finished as normal.  <br/><br/>3-6 he told the truth! The warriors are rewarded 750 gold per level if they left. <br/><br/>If the warriors continued they could be in trouble: roll twice on the objective room monster table to see what monsters lurk within. Any unexpected events automatically bring monsters of maximum numbers if there is a random number. <br/><br/>Roll 1D6, on a 1,2 or 3 draw another event card immediately. |
| Lost Gold. One random warrior finds a hole in his backpack. He has lost 1D6x200 gold per level. If this amount would exceed their total gold they also lose a random piece of treasure/equipment (equal chance of either). <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.             |
| Missed Footing. One of you stumbles on the uneven flooring, leaving you limping.  Randomly determine one warrior, they are on -1 Movement for the rest of the adventure.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.               |
| Lantern Goes Out. A sudden chill breeze blows out the lantern.  Unless the warriors have another light source they are stuck in the darkness until the relight the lantern. They can do nothing else until it is relit, which they can attempt once per turn. Roll 1D6 and they need a 4+ to relight the lantern.  If an unexpected event occurs while the lantern is out then warriors are at -2 to hit due to darkness and cannot use missile weapons at all. Spells have to be able to attack adjacent monsters.             |
| Imperial Knight. An imperial knight enters the room, on some form of quest of which he will not speak. He does however warn you of some monsters that lurk nearby, enabling you to get the jump on them.<br/><br/>During the first turn of the next combat each warrior has an extra 2 attacks.       |
| Curse Of Hashakk. As the last warrior enters this room a disembodied voice echoes out flatly stating that the warriors have entered forbidden halls and must face the curse of Hashakk.  <br/><br/>One of the warriors determined randomly must roll 1D6 and add his strength scoring a 6+rank. If passed he immediately loses 1D6 wounds plus 1D6 wounds per rank with no modifiers.  If failed he loses 1D6 wounds per rank and has -1 strength and toughness for the rest of the adventure.  <br/><br/>Roll another event immediately.        |
| Spider Bite! One of you feels a sharp pain in his neck, as he clutched at it a small red-black spider scuttles off into the darkness faster than you can swat it.  Randomly determine which warrior and roll 1D6  <br/><br/>1-3 poisonous: the warrior takes 1D6 wounds per rank with no modifiers and is at -1 strength until a healing potion is consumed. Magic spells will heal the wounds but not the strength loss.  <br/>4-5 delayed poison: the warrior has no ill effect until the next 1 is rolled in the power phase. At the end of that turn the warrior collapses to the floor. The next turn he can do nothing but monsters will only attack him if they cannot reach other warriors. The turn after that he awakens but all his characteristics are 1 except wounds(which are whatever they should be). His characteristics recover at a rate of 1 point per turn until he is back to maximum again.  <br/>6 boosted metabolism: the warrior loses D3 wounds per rank with no modifiers but has +1 attacks for the rest of the adventure.            |
| Spore Fungus. An incautious move by the warriors kicks up a cloud of spores from the floor.  Each warrior must roll 1D6 to see what effect the spores have on them. <br/><br/>1 soporific: the warrior falls unconscious until a 5+ is rolled in the power phase. Monsters ignore sleeping warriors while others are still fighting.  <br/>2 toxic: the spores cause 1d6 wounds per rank with no modifiers  <br/>3 sneezing fit: the warrior is at -1 to hit for the whole combat due to sneezing  <br/>4 no effect  <br/>5 curative: the warrior heals 1D6 wounds per rank  <br/>6 magical: the warrior gains +1 strength and toughness for the rest of the adventure and is healed to full health.  <br/><br/>Then roll on the monster table to see what shows up and attacks the warriors..            |
| Wounded Knight. You come across the bodies of seven monsters and a badly wounded knight, who is in need of some healing.  One random warrior moves to help the knight, roll 1D6  <br/><br/>1-2 Renegade! The knight was in league with the monsters! He immediately stabs the warrior that came forward, causing 1D6 damage per rank plus 4 then runs off into the darkness.  <br/>3-4 Thief! He was in fact robbing the monsters, when one who was dying slashed him with it's sword. The thief grabs a random item from the warrior and runs off. Roll d6 1-3 equipment 4-6 magic item.  <br/>5-6 Hero! He slew the monsters and is grateful for the warriors help. He gives the warrior who helped him a dungeon room treasure item before leaving the dungeon. Roll twice and pick the one you prefer.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.           |
| Fascination of Slaanesh. Soft seductive voices gently whisper the promises of Slaanesh to the warriors while ambrosian scents fill the air, blinding you to your surroundings.  Each warrior on the board section rolls 1D6 adding their toughness. If they score 6+rank or more they are fine and this has no effect.  Those that roll less become incapable of action. These warriors can do nothing until they are struck in combat and take damage. Monsters automatically hit warriors that are so entranced.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.               |
| Shifting Sands. A deluge of hot sand starts to pour into the room through grilles in the walls and ceiling. Although there is time to escape, this makes the floor very unstable.  <br/><br/>While on this board section each warrior must roll 1D6 and add their strength characteristic at the beginning of the warriors phase. On a roll of 6+1 per rank they are fine to move at half speed. On less than that they cannot move this turn. If they roll a 1 regardless of total they fall prone and are unable to get up due to sand pinning them down.  Monsters are unaffected by the sand as they enter after this has occurred.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.             |
| Changing of the Ways. The powers of magic are a tangible thing here, you can all feel the flow of magic here, even those without magical powers.  <br/><br/>Every warrior has to roll D6 and add their toughness and score 6+rank or be overwhelmed by the power of Tzeentch. For the next 2D6 turns if the warrior rolls a 1 for anything they change into chaos spawn for that turn. While chaos spawn they attack all adjacent models for their turn. This happens even if they have already acted this turn. They can be harmed in the usual way and monsters will still attack them.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.        |
| Berserker Rage of Khorne. Suddenly waves of aggression flow over you all and you feel the wrath of Khorne flow over you.  <br/><br/>Each warrior must roll 1D6 add their strength and score 6+ rank if they succeed they are not affected. Otherwise the warriors are overcome with rage for the next D3+rank turns. While affected by rage they have to attack any adjacent models, chosen at random, and they may not use ranged weapons or cast any spells.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately. If monsters appear they are all ranged monsters, if these are not rolled choose the nearest monsters that are. These monsters are aware of the trap and would prefer the warriors fight each other.              |
| Old Bones. The floor of this chamber is covered with bones with the glint of gold underneath.  <br/><br/>Roll 1D6  <br/>1 trap: cackling laughter echoes around the room and a bolt of magical energy flashes out: each warrior rolls 1D6 lowest is hit for D6 damage per rank with no modifiers. If more than one warrior rolls equally low then they both get hit.  <br/>2-3 illusion: in a bright flash of light the bones and gold vanish: draw another event card.  <br/>4-5 each warrior finds D6x10 gold per level. Draw another event card immediately.  <br/>6 each warrior finds 2D6x10 gold per level. <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.           |
| Mechanical Dwarves. Two small doors set into the wall open and two mechanical dwarves march out of the openings slowly, heading towards the warriors.  <br/><br/>Warriors decide whether to avoid the mechanicals or await their approach. Then roll 1D6  <br/>1 big explosion: warriors are all hit for 2D6 wounds per rank. Draw another event immediately. <br/>2 small explosion: two random warriors take 2D6 wounds per rank. Draw event card immediately.  <br/>3 flash powder: each mechanical places a bag of flash powder on the floor and then returns  <br/>4 firebombs: each mechanical places a firebomb on the floor and then returns  <br/>5 blessing of Grungni: a blessing is placed on all warriors: gain +1 strength for rest of adventure.  <br/>6 healing of Grungni: each warrior regains 5 wounds per rank. If this would exceed their total wounds they gain the excess as temporary wounds which will be lost first.  <br/><br/>If the warriors avoid the mechanicals they get none of the above, but the explosions still attract another event card even though it causes no damage.     |
| Secret Door. Your keen eyes reveal the lines of a hidden door.  <br/><br/>Opening the secret door reveals an additional objective room. The warriors can choose to explore or not bother, continuing with their adventure as normal. <br/>If they do investigate roll twice on the objective room monster table and take the lower result. <br/>Once the monsters have been placed roll once on the trap table too, this room is well defended.  <br/>There are no objective room items however.          |
| Gusts of Wind. There must be holes in the walls or ceiling somewhere because the wind is blasting through this room/corridor.  <br/>While in this room/corridor ranged attacks are at -2 to hit. Adjacent rooms/corridors are at -1 to hit. Once two doors separate the warriors from the room where this occurred the penalties end.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.        |
| Flooded Chamber. This room/corridor is knee deep in water which flows in strange patterns. (if as a result of an unexpected event the water suddenly floods in through holes around knee high)  <br/>The water moves and throws people off balance at odd times. This causes -1 to hit in hand to hand combat and also makes rolls to avoid pinning harder by -1. The water stays on this board section.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.           |
| Secret Door. Your sharp eyes pick out the tell tale lines of a secret door.  <br/><br/>If the players decide to investigate take a spare objective room card along with D3+rank dungeon cards and form a new sub-deck. Work through these cards as normal, however every event card is always preceded by a trap roll (so on an unexpected event a trap occurs before the card is resolved and the same for rooms). The final room is a long hidden treasury and as such is guarded by traps and monsters!  <br/><br/>Roll once on the objective room monster table and then once on the traps tables for each monster roll required. If the trap would result in another event card simply roll another trap until no further event cards would be played. Clearing the objective room results in normal gold and an objective room item each plus D6x100 gold per level and an item of dungeon room treasure for each warrior.            |
| Horror in the Darkness. For a brief moment the light of the lantern is eclipsed as darkness sweeps out from the dungeon and engulfs the warriors. In the darkness each warrior is confronted by his worst nightmare.  <br/><br/>Each warrior must roll 1D6 and add their toughness to the score. They need to roll a 6+rank to pass and if so they gain +1 to hit on their next D3+rank attacks.  <br/>If failed they are terrified for the next combat, while terrified they automatically fail fear and terror rolls and also suffer -1 to hit on top of any fear rules.  <br/><br/>Roll 1D6 on a 1-3 draw another event card immediately.           |
| Vampire Bats. The air is suddenly thick with a cloud of bats, chittering and screeching as they swoop upon and engulf the warriors, these are no ordinary bats but vampire bats!  <br/><br/>Each warrior is attacked by 2D6 plus 2 per rank bats. Each warrior rolls 1D6 and adds their strength to see how many they kill before being swarmed. Any remaining bats cause 1 wound each with no modifiers before then flying off into the darkness.  <br/><br/>Roll 1D6 on a 1-3 draw another event card immediately.           |
| Lost Souls. There is a bizarre moaning and then a handful of ghostly beings streak towards you, leaving no time to react.  <br/><br/>These lost souls flood through the board section and pass through the warriors on their way through. Each warrior is hit by D3 souls per rank and have to make a fear roll to see what damage they take. They need to pass a fear check of dungeon level +4 for each spirit. They lose a wound for every point they fail any of the fear checks by. (so if a level 2 warrior rolls against 4 souls with a fear of 6 an score 3,5,7,8 they would lose 4 and 2 wounds for a total of 6 wounds lost. There is no way to reduce this damage.    |
| Collapse. The beams holding the ceiling up in one corner collapse, sending masonry and stonework crashing to the ground. As the dust settles, you can see another passage leading away into the darkness.  <br/><br/>Another doorway is available leading to a corridor. After that the dungeon carries on as if this was a T junction.          |
| Dying Dwarf.  You find a badly wounded dwarf in the dungeon, his wounds are severe and he eyes you dangerously, growling, while holding something clutched to his chest.    <br/><br/> The warriors have the choice of attacking him or trying to talk to him. Roll 1D6 for talking to him  <br/>1 the dwarf mistakes you for monsters in his wounded state, the bag is full of firebombs! Each warrior takes 1D6 wounds per rank with no modifiers. This also happens if warriors attack him.  <br/>2-3 the dwarf is dying and drops a firebomb from his bag by accident, one warrior takes 1D6 wounds with no modifiers.  <br/>4-5 the dwarf realizes you are not monsters and hands you a firebomb or flash powder before then dying. Determine which it is randomly.  <br/>6 dying runesmith: the dwarf is a runesmith and hands over a runestone before dying. Roll 1D6 1-3 weapon rune, 4-6 armor runes. Randomize what it is in the usual way.1 is still a 1 though.  <br/><br/>The warriors can add +1 to the roll for each dwarf they have in the party. <br/><br/>Roll 1D6 on a 1-3 draw another event card immediately.       |
| Dwarf Ghost. The luminous form of a ghostly dwarf materializes in front of the warriors. It is the spirit of a venerable dwarf gold hunter who warns the warriors about the dangers deeper in the catacombs.  The warriors may ignore any one event or monster roll later in this adventure, that event just does not happen.     |
| Drain Magic. Suddenly the magic in this part of the dungeon seems to be sucked away, even your glowing magical weapons seem to dim slightly.   <br/><br/>For the next D3+rank turns magic spells are impossible to cast and even scrolls and items that cast spells fail to function.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.         |
| Collapsing Ceiling. Suddenly rocks start falling from the ceiling.  <br/><br/>A random warrior is struck by falling masonry, taking damage equal to 1D6 plus 1D6 per rank modified as normal. Any adjacent models take half the modified damage with no modifiers too. In the power phase every turn while on this board section another rock falls from the ceiling hitting another random warrior, the monsters are used to keeping an eye on this so do not get hit, but are still liable to be harmed by being adjacent to a struck warrior.  <br/><br/>Roll 1D6 on a 1-3 draw another event card immediately.     |
| Slop Bucket.  From above comes an unpleasant noise, followed by the contents of a slop bucket!  <br/><br/>A random warrior is covered with the stench! For the rest of the adventure monsters in excess of the one on one rules will not attack this warrior!        |
| TRAP! Roll on the traps table.     |
| Magical Pattern. The walls of this room are covered with magical patterns that suck the warriors in and keep them rooted to the spot.   <br/> <br/>No monsters will enter this room, if any are due to appear they appear outside the room and use ranged attacks instead. If this event is rolled while monsters are in the room they are affected as the warriors are.   <br/> <br/>Roll 1D6 at the start or the models turn, on a 3+ they are not affected. On a 1-2 the model stays where it is and does nothing this turn, it is treated as having a weapon skill of 1 too.   <br/> <br/>Roll 1D6 on a 1-3 draw another event card immediately.      |
| Weapons Rack?  This appears to be a dumping ground for all manner of weapons discarded due to breakage or simply finding a new one, the floor is littered with them.  <br/><br/>The warriors can search here to see if there is anything rescue-able or not as they see fit. If so roll 1D6  <br/><br/>1 the warriors find nothing but set off a trap roll on traps table.  <br/>2 the warriors find nothing but attract attention, roll on monsters table.  <br/>3-4 the warriors find nothing after a few minutes of searching.  <br/>5 one of the warriors finds an item, randomize the warrior they gain a roll on weapons/armor table.  <br/>6 they find a stash of weapons, each warrior can roll on the weapons/armor table.    |
| FLESH EATING BEETLES: a host of flesh eating scarab beetles flood into the chamber from a hole in the wall. The warriors have to grasp the masonry to pull themselves out of reach of these scarabs while they flood through the room.  <br/><br/>Each warrior must roll 2D6 and add their initiative to the result. They need to score 10+rank in order to avoid the scarabs, once they are successful they are out of reach. If they fail they lose 1D3 wounds per rank with no modifiers and they must try again next round. This will continue until the warriors all manage to get out of reach of the beetles or until warriors are all dead.    |
| BANSHEE! A withered haggard creature lurches out of the darkness, one look at her face warns you that she is a Banshee! Almost immediately she screeches loud enough to wake the dead.  <br/><br/>Each warrior must roll 1D6 and add their toughness, if they score a 7+rank they lose one wound per level with no modifiers. If they fail they lose 1D6 wounds for every 1 they failed this check by with no modifiers.  <br/><br/>Any warrior reduced to zero wounds by this attack must roll 1D6 on a 1 they are dead from shock. The Banshee escapes in the shock.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.      |
| FORTUNE: one of the warriors finds a trinket of gold in the shape of a sun, soon all the warriors are starting to feel uplifted and as if they're being watched over by someone.  <br/><br/>For the rest of this adventure all the warriors have one extra luck. At the end of the adventure the trinket may be sold at a settlement for D6x25gold.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.     |
| MAGICAL OVERLOAD: the power of magic suddenly becomes overpowering; all spell casting warriors and monsters struggle to control the huge power suddenly flowing through them.  <br/><br/>Each warrior who can cast spells must roll 1D6 and so must each spell casting enemy.  <br/><br/>1 take damage equal to 1D6 per level with no modifiers. The model also collapses and can do nothing this turn.  <br/>2-3 overwhelmed: the model takes -2 to strength and toughness for this entire combat.  <br/>4-5 the model can act this turn but cannot cast spells.  <br/>6 the model immediately casts a free spell with no chance of failure and free of power. This also cannot be dispelled or resisted.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.   |
| MIST? Mist seems to be seeping into this part of the dungeon and is not clearing up.  <br/><br/>The mist emanates from this room and causes all ranged attacks to be at -2 to hit and Movement to be reduced by 2 as well. This room is always misty, but as the warriors continue their journey underground the mist follows them, continuing these penalties until a 6 is rolled in the power phase. Obviously rolling a 6 while in this room/corridor does not stop the mist, it must be rolled once this board section has been left.   |
| CURSE OF YEARS: time drags slowly as the warriors proceed on their way, eventually they realize they have been travelling a really long time. Looking at each other they realize they are all looking different!  <br/><br/>Each warrior must roll 1D6  <br/>1 the warrior is now old and grey, his grip is frail and he is feeling weak. The warrior is at -1 strength or toughness and loses D3 wounds permanently.  <br/>2-5 the warrior has a few grey flecks in his hair, but no other problems.  <br/>6 the warrior has regained some youth! Gain +1 strength and toughness for the rest of the adventure and +1 permanent wound. |
| GHOST: you realize you have been followed by a ghostly figure for a few minutes; a proud looking man wearing fine armor but lacking any weapon. He points at one of the warriors.  <br/><br/>He indicates that the warrior is carrying a weapon that was his in life, randomize which weapon the warrior is carrying. If the warrior decides not to give him the weapon the ghost touches him, paralyzing him for D6+level turns. Draw another event card immediately. Any monsters will still attack the paralyzed warrior and automatically hit. Traps cannot be avoided either.  <br/><br/>If the warrior gives him the weapon then he takes it, pointing out a corner and saying  “Therein lie some helpful amulets, if only I had found them while I still lived”  the warriors find four amulets, each contain a number of luck points equal to D3 plus rank, once they are used they are permanently gone.    |
| THICK COBWEBS: walking through the dungeon you suddenly find yourself ensnared in thick cobwebs and suddenly it is very difficult to move.  <br/><br/>Each warrior is enmeshed in these thick cobwebs. In order to break free of the webbing the warrior needs to roll 1D6 plus their strength and score 6+rank in the power phase. Failure means the warrior cannot do anything else that turn.  <br/><br/>Monsters are at +1 to hit webbed warriors except spiders which have their own rules.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately. |
| LOOSE STALACTITES: stalactites cover the ceiling of this chamber, suddenly some start falling down upon your heads!  <br/><br/>At the start of each warriors turn they roll 1D6 and on a 1-3 they are hit by a falling stalactite, causing D6+level wounds ignoring modifiers. This happens while the warriors remain in this room. Monsters are only hit on a 1 as they are used to this, roll before each monsters own turn.  <br/><br/>Roll 1D6 on a 1-3 draw another event card immediately.         |
|  ROLL TWICE: roll two events on this table.    |
