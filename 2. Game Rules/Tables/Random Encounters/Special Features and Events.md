|      | Shriekers: Each character must make a dodge roll at level 1+D3. If any character fails, the Shriekers are awakened. Roll a d6: 1-3 Roll on the Wandering Monsters table. 4-6 The next time the party enters a room/corridor with occupants (Vermin/Minions/Boss/Weird) they are alerted. You automatically roll on the Reaction table for the encounter; you can't choose not to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|      | Shrine: The first time the party enter the Shrine roll a D6 for each character. If the score is greater than their remaining Life then they recover 2 Life. Unique.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|      | Storeroom: Roll d6x5. The party can search this room once and find items from the equipment list up to the value in GP of the number rolled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|      | Dread Portal: The party may pass through the Dread Portal and end up in any mapped room/corridor they wish. However each and every time the party chooses to pass through it, roll a D6 for each member. On a '1' they are lost in the portal. From now on, each time you enter a new area, immediately roll a D6 for each lost party member. On a '6' they reappear at your current location. You may opt to stay in an area and wait for them to reappear; test for Wandering Monsters each time you roll. If you leave the dungeon, or all party members become lost in the portal, anyone lost is lost forever. The portal may be used any number of times. |
|      | Crypt: you may leave the crypt alone, or search it. On a 1-3 you awaken the dead – fight D6+2 skeletons (see Vermin Table). The skeletons have surprise and attack first.  Skeletons or no, you find 2D6x10 gold pieces                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|      | Control Room: The traps of this dungeon are maintained from here. You may try to figure out the mechanisms by rolling against a d6+1 puzzle. For every failed attempt, test for wandering monsters on a 1-2. Wizards and rogues add their level to their puzzle-solving roll. If the puzzle is solved, reduce the Level of all traps encountered from now on by 1. Once only – treat further rolls as Puzzle Room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|      | Fountain: All wounded characters recover 1 Life the first time they encounter a fountain in an adventure. Further fountains have no effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|      | Blessed Temple: A character of your choice gains a +1 on Attack against undead monsters or demons. As soon as the character kills at least one undead or demon, the bonus is gone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|      | Armory: All characters can change their weapons if they want, within the limits of the weapons allowed to their character type. For example, a Warrior who was using a sword and shield may discard his shield and take a two-handed weapon, or exchange his sword for a mace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|      | Cursed Altar: As you enter the room, an eerie glow emanates from a sinister altar. A random character is cursed and has now -1 on his Defense rolls. To break the curse, the character must either slay a boss monster alone, or enter a Blessed Temple (see 2, above), or have a Blessing spell cast on himself by a cleric.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|      | Statue: you may leave the statue alone or touch it. If you touch it, roll d6. On a 1–3, the statue awakens and attacks your party (level 4 boss with 6 life points, immune to all spells; if you defeat it, you find 3d6 x 10 gold pieces inside). On a 4-6, the statue breaks, and you find 3d6 x 10 gold pieces inside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|      | Puzzle Room: the room contains a puzzle box. Its level is d6. You may leave it alone or try to solve it. For every failed attempt, the character trying to solve it loses 1 life. Wizards and rogues add their level to their puzzle-solving roll. If the puzzle is solved, the box opens: make a Treasure roll to determine its contents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|      | Enchanted Banquet. A sumptuously laid table is the room. You may eat and drink, or leave it alone. If you eat, roll on the Enchanted Banquet table for every character who ate. Decide if you eat before reading the possible outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|      | Lava River. A random magic item is protected by a lava river crossing the room and flowing from East to West. If a character wants to leap over the river, he must roll versus a level 6 difficulty. Add +1 if the character is a halfling or an elf, subtract -1 if the character is a dwarf or wears heavy armor. A rogue adds +L. On a success, the character leaps on the other side and may take a random item from the Abyss magic treasure table. Once the character has taken the object, he must roll again to jump back on the other side. Failing the roll means the character takes 1d6 wounds.                                                     |
|      | Room of Horrors. The room is a torture chamber, an abattoir, or another source of unbearable evil. All characters gain 1 Madness point and must save versus level 6 fear or be at -1 on all Attack rolls until a Blessing spell is cast (one spell per affected character). Wizards and clerics save at +1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|      | Chained Monster. The room is a prison. A random Abyss boss is trapped here. The party may leave him alone, kill him (gaining no XP rolls or treasure for this cowardly act) or set him free. If the party sets the monster free, the monster will give the party d6 x d6 gp and reveal them a clue. However, when you meet the final boss, there is a 2 in 6 chance that the monster you set free will be with him in the room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|      | Repository of Secret Knowledge. The room is a library. If you want to spend some time in research here, roll for wandering monsters. At the end of the research, a character will automatically gain a clue. Roll d8, on a 1 or 2 the character also gains 1 Madness point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|      | Puzzle Room. The room contains a puzzle box. Its level is d8 +4. You may leave it alone or try to solve it. For every failed attempt, the character trying to solve it loses 1 life or gains 1 Madness (your choice). Wizards and rogues add +L to their puzzle-solving roll.

The Swarm is automatically dispersed after that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|      | Secret Stairs. The room contains a secret passage to a room or corridor of your choice on the upper level of the dungeon. This may not be the first room (the entrance) to the dungeon, or any room or section of corridor adjacent to that. If you decide to take the stairs, roll a 1 in 6 chance of meeting a wandering monster there. If you are playing an Abyss dungeon without an upper level, the secret stairs lead to a random room or corridor with no exits. Roll for content of this room twice and choose your preferred result.                                                                                                                                                           |
|      | The Gold Ghost. You meet the hungry spirit of a deceased treasure hunter. You may appease the spirit by sacrificing 100 gp worth of treasure. If you do not do this, the ghost will curse you, and all characters will be at -1 on their Defense rolls until a Blessing spell is cast on them (one spell per person is required).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|      | Mana Sink. All spellcasters must save versus a power 7 mana sink or lose their spells. Roll once per spell. On a success, the spell is not lost. Spells on scrolls and magic items are unaffected. Characters add +½ level. If the party moves through the room with mana sink again, do not apply the effect a second time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
