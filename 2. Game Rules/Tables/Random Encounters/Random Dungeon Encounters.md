| d6 Redcaps. Level 3, treasure 1 roll, morale +0. Very angry, potty-mouthed dwarfs who continually swear throughout the fight. They wear enchanted, blood soaked caps, and when you attack them, treat them as if level 8. Only redcaps can wear them.

They will not have religious relics in their treasure (re-roll any relics found). <br/><br/>Reactions: fight.                                                                                                                                        |
| Ghosts. A few ghosts of recently deceased people fly through the party, with cold mists trailing after them. All heroes must save vs L5 Fear or lose 1 life. Clerics add +1 and must roll before other characters. If a Cleric rolls an explosive result on this save, all other characters (including other clerics in the party) gain a +1 to their save. Necromancers, paladins and questing knights automatically save. The ghosts then disappear in the distance. The ghosts have no stats because it is impossible to fight them, but they do count as a minion encounter for XP purposes.   |
| 2d6 Death Cultists. Level 3, Treasure +1. Their fanatical attack means that all defense rolls are at -1. <br/><br/>Reactions: Always fight to the death                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Doppelganger. Level 5, 5 life, normal treasure. Before the party attacks, the doppelganger takes the form of a random character. Each turn, a save vs level 4 confusion must be made by the other characters. On a failure, they will not attack, being confused about who is real. The mimicked character may attack as normal. The doppelganger attacks the mimicked character. If that character dies, the doppelganger flees. <br/><br/>Reaction: fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Lurking Mantlebeast Level 6, 5 life, no treasure, no attacks (but see below). This manta-like monster hides on a ceiling and cannot be met as a wandering monster. You have a 2 in 6 chance (4 in 6 if you have a Rogue) to spot it. If so, you can turn back. If you don’t turn back, or fail to spot, the beast drops upon the party. All must save vs level 3 dodge (-1 if wearing heavy armor, +1 if Elf or Rogue). Those who failed cannot attack and lose 1 life every defense turn until the lurker is killed by characters who passed, who can attack it without needing to defend. <br/><br/>Reaction: fight to the death (it is unintelligent and never flees).                                                                                                                                                          |
| Green slime. Level 6, 8 life, 3 attacks, no treasure. If the green slime hits, it does no damage, but the character must save vs level 4 green slime disease (Halflings add ½ level). In future, whenever a life point is lost by an affected character, they lose another life point. This affliction can be cured with a bless spell. If killed while uncured, the affected character becomes another green slime and attacks the party. <br/><br/>Reaction: fight to the death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Jelly Cube. Level 6, 6 life, 3 treasure rolls. The cube is transparent and has a 3 in 6 chance of attacking first. It does no damage, but each character must save vs level 2 engulf each turn (level 4 if that character attacked it with a hand melee weapon last turn). An engulfed character cannot attack. A character is freed if the cube is killed. A rogue does not get an outnumbering bonus against a cube. The cube is immune to sleep and lightning spells. <br/><br/>Reaction: fight to the death                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Flesh Golem. Level 7, 8 life, normal treasure, 2 attacks, morale +2. The golem is immune to crushing weapons and all spells except fireball. The golem inflicts 2 wounds if you roll 1 in defense. <br/><br/>Reactions (d6): 1-2 peaceful, 3-6 fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Owlbear. Level 6, 8 life, 1 treasure roll + skin + food. Ranger types gain a +1 defense vs owlbears.  If encountered in a forest, the owlbear has a 2 in 6 chance of surprise, reduced to 1 in 6 if you have a druid or wood elf in the party.  The beast performs 3 attacks: 1 bite and 2 claw attacks.  Both claw attacks must be directed at the same opponent.  If both hit, the owlbear squeezes the character in a bear hug.  The victim must perform a L6 strength save or immediately take additional damage.  If the save fails, the owlbear will automatically hit the unfortunate adventurer next turn with both claws and bite.  The character gets a chance to break out of the hug every turn. (See Lantern issue 2, page 15)<br/><br/>Reactions (d6): 1-2 Bribe (4 food rations), 3-4 Fight, 5-6 Fight to the death |
| Minotaur. Level 5, 4 life points, 2 attacks, normal treasure. Due to the power of his bull-rush charge, the first Defense roll against a minotaur is at -1. Minotaurs hate halflings (actually, they love to eat them). <br/><br/>Reactions (d6): 1-2 bribe (60 gp), 3–4 fight, 6 fight to the death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Iron Eater. Level 3, 4 life, 3 attacks, no treasure. Defense rolls against the iron eater do not enjoy bonus from heavy armor (shield and light armor count). If the monster hits, the character takes no damage but loses his armor, shield, main weapon, or 3d6 gp, in this order. <br/><br/>Reactions (d6): 1 flee, 2-3 bribe (d6 gp to distract the creature; you may not fool the creature with fools gold), 4-6 fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Chimera. Level 5, 6 life points, 3 attacks, normal treasure. On every of the chimera’s turns, roll d6. On a 1 or 2 the chimera breathes fire instead of performing its multiple attacks. All characters must save versus level 4 fire or lose 1 life. <br/><br/>Reactions (d6): 1 bribe (50 gp), 2–6 fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Catoblepas. Level 4, 4 life points, treasure +1. All characters at the beginning of the battle must save versus a level 4 gaze attack or lose 1 life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Giant Spider. Level 5, 3 life, 2 attacks, 2 treasure rolls. Characters taking a wound must save versus level 3 poison or lose an additional life. Due to the spider’s webbing, the party may not withdraw from this fight unless they cast a Fireball spell to burn the webs. <br/><br/>Reactions: always fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Invisible Gremlins. The party stumbles upon a band of gremlins who steal d6+3 objects from the party. You must surrender objects from any of your characters in this order of preference: magic items, scrolls, potions, weapons, gems, coins (in bundles of 10 gp each). If the gremlins steal ALL of your equipment, they will leave a thank you message that counts as a clue (see p.55) The gremlins have no combat stats because it is impossible to fight them. Encountering them gives no XP roll                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Black ooze. Level 3, 12 life points, no treasure. The ooze will form a number of pseudopods equal to the number of targets available, so that every target receives one attack. The party can withdraw from the combat (receiving one last attack) even if there is no door to slam shut between them and the ooze. The black ooze is vulnerable to salt as is automatically killed if a sack of salt is thrown at it. Salt may be found as loot or purchased in town for 6 gp. <br/><br/>Reactions: always fight to the death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Black Manticore. Level 5, 5 life, normal treasure and morale. A manticore always performs 2 attacks against the same target. Roll d6 to determine the nature of these attacks. 1-2 claw attack (1 wound), 3-4 bite (2 wounds), 5-6 tail strike (1 wound, plus a Save vs level 2 poison or die instantly). A character may decide to attack the manticore’s tail by striking a level 6 target. A wound on the tail will disable it. If the tail is disabled, when the d6 roll indicates a tail strike, the manticore will just skip an attack, but the wound inflicted on the tail does not count against the manticore’s total Life points. <br/><br/>Reactions: 1-2 bribe (50 gp), 3-4 fight, 5-6 fight to the death.                                                                                                             |
| Gray Slime. Level 5, 6 life, 2 attacks, no treasure, never tests morale. The gray slime has a 1 in 6 chance of surprising the party. If the gray slime hits, the character must either sacrifice his shield, weapon, lantern, armor (choose one) or take 2 wounds. Gray slime moves very slowly so the party may choose to withdraw from the fight even if there is no door to slam shut between them and the slime. A bag of salt thrown at a slime inflicts 2 wounds. Slimes are often set as guardians of secret doors. A room that was guarded by a slime may be searched once the slime has been killed, just like an empty room. <br/><br/>Reaction: 1-2 peaceful, 3-6 fight to the death.                                                                                                                                   |
