## Oaths

| dice: 2d6 | Type / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Never Yield - The PK must never give up once combat has begun. If the PK is defeated, he or she must either be killed or lose 12 VP for Yielding and breaking this Oath. The PK may, however, agree to stop a combat in progress due to a Combat Event, since this is not Yielding (see page 62). |
| 3 | Use no Weapons - One die must always be used in combat, as the PK may not use a sword or lance. |
| 4 | Always Help Ladies - Whenever the PK encounters a Lady, any of her Requests (such as for Aid or Escort) must be granted. When receiving a Message of Lady Summons, the PK must immediately travel to her Castle by the shortest route (if he serves a Lady). When hearing of an Adventure involving a Lady, the PK must pursue it. When hearing of an insult to a Lady, the PK must challenge the Knight who insulted her. |
| 5 | Always Grant Requests - The PK must grant any requests for Aid (including Escorts) or Prayers made of him. |
| 6 | Fight Without Advantage - The PK must always fight chivalrously against Knightly opponents (see COMBAT: CHIVALRY, page 57). |
| 7 | Spare the Lives of Knights - The PK must not slay any Knights he or she defeats  |
| 8 | Serve Only Present Lord - The PK may never change Lords (thus, may never become an Arthurian Knight if not already one…). |
| 9 | Never Break Oaths - No Oaths sworn by the PK may be willingly broken. This Oath also protects the other Oaths: in order to be released from any Oath, the PK must first be released from this one. |
| 10 | Always Travel Alone - The PK may never have companions (a Dwarf, Mascot, or Man-at-Arms), nor may Escorts be performed; the PK will not permit others (comrades) to join him. |
| 11 | Do Not Eat - The PK must not eat anything. This will have the same effect as (but not the awards of) a Penance of fasting (all combat rolls are divided in half, rounded down). This Oath may only be broken at the end of a turn. |
| 12 | Never Avoid Encounters - No Encounter may ever be avoided. The PK may not flee as a result of a Combat Event either |

### Oaths
An Oath is an indicated course of action to which the PK must adhere. Oaths may be forced on a PK by Knight’s Fate, by a Trick, as a result of meeting a Lady, King, or Hermit, or during a prison release. The Oath should be noted on the PK’s Adventure Journal and erased once broken or removed. Several Oaths may be sworn at one time.

### Breaking Oaths
If a sworn Oath is broken, the PK immediately loses 12 VP. A PK may be Tricked (see Oaths table) into breaking an Oath. A PK cannot break an Oath voluntarily unless he has enough VP to pay the penalty.

### Removing Oaths
An Oath may be removed without penalty by a Goodly Hermit Man, either through a Request or by obtaining a “release from oath/heal” reaction from him. A Wood Nymph will also release a PK from any Oaths.

## Tricks

| dice: 2d6 | Type / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Abandon Lady (Lord) - The PK is tricked into abandoning his Lady (including an Enchantress), which results in the loss of 6 VP (12 VP if under Summons) and the Service Award. If the PK is not serving a Lady, the PK will abandon his Lord, for a loss of 6 VP (12 VP if under Summons). |
| 3 | Imprisonment - The PK is immediately imprisoned; a Castle is deployed on top of the PK if he is not already at one. No Appeal may be made to the Jailor (see Appeal to Jailor table). |
| 4 | Fight Enemy Unarmed - A random NPK must be fought immediately by the unarmed PK. No combat awards are given, but the PK has a chance to request chivalrous combat. |
| 5 | Break (Swear) an Oath - One of the PK’s sworn Oaths must be broken (with the consequent VP loss). If no Oaths have been sworn, the PK must swear one. |
| 6 | Lose Horses - The PK is Tricked into giving away his horse (and that of his Dwarf, if applicable). |
| 7 | Tell a Lie - This most common Trick results in the PK telling a lie; however, only 1 VP is lost (instead of the normal 6 VP loss). |
| 8 | Fight an Enemy - A random NPK must be fought by the PK, alone. The PK’s companions and comrades may not aid in the combat. If the PK is defeated, he will suffer Knight’s Fate. |
| 9 | Lose Lance - The PK is Tricked into giving away his lance (plus the extra one, if applicable). |
| 10 | Escort Pilgrims - As if a Penance, the PK must Escort Pilgrims (see Requests table) by the shortest path to a randomly determined Shrine (see Shrine table). No awards are given for completing the Escort. If the PK refuses or if a detour is made, the PK loses 12 VP. |
| 11 | Deliver a Message - The PK must immediately travel to a randomly determined royal Castle, and must obtain a friendly Castle reaction to deliver a message. The PK will receive no awards for completing the task, and will lose 12 VP for detouring or refusing the task. The exact message need not be determined. |
| 12 | Prophecy - A randomly determined Adventure is given to the PK as a Prophecy. The PK will receive awards for the performance of the Adventure. |

### Tricks
An encountered person may attempt to Trick a PK. The PK may attempt to escape a Trick (Luck Test). If a PK successfully escapes a Hermit’s Trick, the PK will gain 6 VP; this is the only case where an award results from escaping a Trick. If the attempt fails, the PK loses 6 VP and the Trick is randomly determined.

## Combat Events

| dice: 2d6 | Type / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Player Knight’s Party Leaves - Any Men-at-Arms and Dwarf (unless Arthurian) in the PK’s party leave the scene of the combat, deserting the PK. Comrades leave if they fail a VL Check. A Mascot stays. |
| 3 | Player Knight’s Shield Broken - The opponent of the PK will gain a +2 on his Attack Dice for the rest of the combat. The PK may attempt to recover a spare shield from his Dwarf (Luck Test). |
| 4 | Player Knight’s Weapon Broken - The PK may switch to another available weapon or attempt to get a replacement weapon from his Dwarf (Luck Test). |
| 5 | Player Knight’s Horse Killed - If the PK is on horseback, his horse is killed, and he is unhorsed and reduced to fighting on foot with a sword. Otherwise, this result has no effect. The PK may attempt to mount his spare horse, if he possesses one, by making a successful Luck Test. |
| 6 | Player Knight Unhorsed (horse still alive) - The PK is knocked off his horse. The PK may attempt to remount (Luck Test). If he fails to remount, he must fight on foot with a sword. Optional rule: If the PK’s CP is at least 50 more than his opponent’s, he takes a wound instead of being unhorsed. |
| 7 | Offer to Break off Combat - If the PK wishes to stop the fighting, the opponent will agree if he passes a VL Check. If the fight stops, award CP and VP as if it had been a challenge (see page 63). Any remaining hostile NPKs will also stop on a successful VL Check. No Knight’s Fate may be assigned by either side if this fight stops, even if other fights break out. |
| 8 | Opponent Unhorsed (horse still alive) - The opponent is knocked off his horse and will not remount. If the PK is still on horseback, he must choose whether or not to fight chivalrously (dismount). Optional rule: If the opponent’s CP is at least 50 more than the PK’s, he takes a wound instead. |
| 9 | Opponent’s Horse Killed - If the opponent is on horseback, his horse is killed and he must fight on foot with a sword. The PK must decide whether or not to fight his disadvantaged foe chivalrously. |
| 10 | Opponent’s Weapon Broken - The opponent will change weapons if he has another (each NPK initially has a full set of knightly equipment). If an advantage is gained by the PK, he must choose whether or not to fight chivalrously. |
| 11 | Opponent’s Shield Broken - If the opponent is a knightly foe, his shield is broken, and the PK will gain +2 on his Attack Dice if he still uses a shield. Should this result give the PK an advantage, he must choose whether or not to fight chivalrously. |
| 12 | Reinforcement Arrives (a Knight joins the PK) - A randomly drawn NPK arrives. He joins the PK’s party and will assist in combat if the PK is defeated. If the PK has sworn an Oath to always travel alone, the reinforcement may be told to depart after the combat, and the PK will not be penalized in any way because of his arrival. |

## Knight's Fate

| dice: 1d6 | Type / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 1 †| Grants Request - In a rare burst of generosity the victor offers to grant any one Request of the loser’s. These include: Join, Give Equipment (if available), Heal, Lift Enchantment, or Arthur’s Favor. A losing NPK will Request to Join the victor as a comrade. |
| 2 *| Sends to Shrine - The victor sends the loser on a pilgrimage to a random Shrine (Shrine table). If a PK chooses this fate for another PK, he may choose the Shrine (but not Rome). |
| 3 | Commends on Skill - The victor admires the skill of the defeated and instructs the loser in combat. The loser gains 6 VP. |
| 4 †| Free Release - The victor exacts no penalty. |
| 5 *| Exacts Oath - The loser must swear one random Oath (Oaths table). If a PK chooses this fate for another PK, he may choose the Oath. |
| 6 *| Sends to Lord - The loser must report to the victor’s Lord. If the victor is an Arthurian Knight, the Lord is King Arthur; otherwise, a Lord must be determined at random. To complete this Fate, the loser must obtain a friendly Castle reaction, but the Castle will not remain friendly after the PK leaves. If the victor is a King, the loser must Escort the King to his royal Castle; the Castle reaction is normal. If assigned at the destination Castle, treat as 5. |
| 7 †*| Demands Company - If the victor is a PK, he may choose this Fate for a losing Knight only if currently pursuing an Adventure; the NPK becomes a Man-at-Arms (if the PK has none) or comrade (otherwise). If the victor is an NPK, the losing PK must accompany him on a randomly determined Adventure (rerolling any 5:6 TOURNAMENT AT CAMELOT result) as a Man-at-Arms. The PK will not receive any awards for the Adventure. The victor is the leader and will thus fight first in each encounter. If he is defeated and the PK proceeds to win the day, he can then leave without any penalty (like a Man-at-Arms), or stay with his victor and share the Adventure normally. |
| 8 †| Will Join - The victor will ride with the loser for a time as a comrade. If the victor is an NPK, his Castle is added to the PK’s list of friendly castles. |
| 9 *| Charges with Adventure - The victor sends the loser on a randomly determined Adventure (rerolling any 5:6 TOURNAMENT AT CAMELOT result), which the loser must immediately undertake. Normal awards will be given if successful, but no points will be awarded for failure. If a PK chooses this fate for another PK and the location of the Adventure is random, the PK may choose where the Adventure occurs (except in Faerie or the Road to Rome). |
| 10-11 †| Robs - The victor steals all of the loser’s equipment. A PK may choose to rob in order to replace broken or stolen items or slain horses. (Optional Rule: If the PK initiated the combat and chooses to rob his foe, he forfeits any VP award) |
| 12 *| Exiles - The loser must leave by the most direct means and never return to the Kingdom or Logres castellany in which the combat occurred. If he should return to the area, the PK loses 12 VP, but may remove the Exile (if he does not have 12 VP to lose, the Exile remains). If King Arthur assigns this Fate, the Exile concerns all of the Logres castellanies. |
| 13 †| Declared Enemy - The victor scars the loser for life (he loses 20 CP), and declares him an enemy. If enemy Knights meet each other later during the game, their reaction will automatically be to attack and they will fight till one or the other is slain. A PK who defeats another PK may not choose this Fate. |
| 14 †| Imprisons - The victor takes the loser to a nearby Castle and imprisons him there. A PK who wishes to Imprison must own a Castle (Castle Reactions table) and escort the defeated Knight to it. A Castle-owning PK can alternately send the defeated Knight to his Castle as a guard. A defeated PK may not refuse to be imprisoned, but he may refuse to be sent as a guard. |
| 15 | Poisoned Wounds - The victor inflicts up to 5 Poisoned Wounds upon the loser. The number given to the loser must not slay him. A PK may choose to give any number of Poisoned Wounds up to a maximum of 5, as long as the restriction is obeyed. |
| 16+ †| Slay | The victor slays the loser immediately. A PK may not slay another PK or a King. |

### Knight’s Fate
Whenever a Knight is defeated by another Knight or King in a fight (and some challenges), the defeated Knight is subject to a Knight’s Fate. The defeated PK rolls one die and adds it to the VL of the victor (or the VL of the King or Lady leading the victor); the resulting number is then looked up on the Knight’s Fate chart, below. A PK who surrenders to a victor’s terms is honour-bound to observe them.

If the PK strays from the agreed terms, he loses 12 VP. Only certain Knight’s Fates may be refused by PKs: these are marked with an asterisk (*) after the number on the Knight’s Fate chart. Other Fates may not be refused (meaning 12 VP cannot be lost for “disobeying” them). Certain Knight’s Fates have no game effects when chosen for vanquished NPKs; to facilitate matters, those that can be meaningfully chosen for NPKs are marked with a dagger (†).

## Ransom

Ransoming Knights: If you have a castle and you have captured a knight, you may ransom him.  Demand a sum of GOLD. Roll 1D6 and keep adding the total until you have rolled a 1 three times.  If the total exceeds your demand, receive the sum of GOLD you demanded. Otherwise, you must keep the knight.
