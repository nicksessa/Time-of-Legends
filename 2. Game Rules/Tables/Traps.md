Pit traps and escaping: the usual ways of escaping pits are to use rope or magic. How ever if those are not available then one warrior, the one in the pit normally, can use their clothes as makeshift rope which then need to be replaced in the next settlement. This makeshift rope only lasts one pit trap so is less reliable than an actual rope.   While in a pit the warrior cannot attack anything outside the pit, even those at the pit edge. Getting out takes a full turn. Magic works as normal.  All traps that affect a random warrior should be assumed to have been set off by that warrior, unless otherwise noted, for the purposes of skills or items that bypass traps.

| LIGHTNING BOLT: random warrior is hit by a lightning bolt that causes D6 wounds + D6 per rank ignoring armour. After resolving this damage the warrior rolls a D6 on a 1-3 it bounces to the next nearest warrior.

| LOG ON A CHAIN: a log on a chain swings down from above, crashing into a random warrior and any warrior adjacent is also hit.

| ROLLING BOULDER: a huge boulder falls into the room and rolls towards a random warrior, crushing all in it's path.  <br/>It enters play in a square adjacent to the warrior if possible, but always into an empty square, and rolls into that warrior by the shortest route possible, hitting all other models on the way in. To avoid the boulder roll your pinning roll, even if not pinned, a successful roll indicates you have avoided it. Monsters use their initiative, rolling 2D6 and needing to score lower with the total.  <br/>Models hit take 4D6 wounds per rank and are also knocked prone, prone models grant enemies +1 to hit them. The boulder continues it's movement until it hits a solid wall and then that square remains blocked for the rest of the encounter. If a model is in that square they continue as normal standing atop the rubble, but must leave as soon as a space is available.  <br/><br/>If there is no space for the boulder to fall into play it falls onto the warrior who gets to roll as per the rules, the boulder shatters so he is not pinned beneath it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| SPIKES THROUGH THE WALLS: randomize warrior, the spikes shoot through the walls hitting that warrior. In a corridor they shoot from the sides and hit whatever model is adjacent to the warrior. In a room they shoot from below and above and only hit that warrior.  <br/>The spikes deal 1D3 wounds per rank with no modifiers and then retract into the wall. The trap remains and will be set off by anyone else moving into the square for the rest of the dungeon.  <br/>Monsters do not set the trap off, but are affected if a warrior sets them off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| STONE BLOCK a random warrior finds a stone block falling on top of him, roll 1D6 and add initiative, requiring a 6+rank to avoid.  <br/>On a roll of a 1 the block slams onto them causing 2D6 wounds per rank and pushes warrior to adjacent square and knocks them prone. Monsters get +1 to hit prone warriors.  <br/>On a failed check the warrior is struck with a glancing blow and suffers 1D6 wounds plus 1D6 per rank and moves to an adjacent square.  <br/>On a successful check the warrior avoids the block and moves to an adjacent square.  <br/>In all cases the square is now blocked by the stone block and cannot be moved through or shot through.  <br/><br/>Roll 1D6 on a 1-3 draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| CAGE a random warrior has a large steel cage fall from above, trapping him within. While trapped the warrior cannot move but can still fight, at -1 to hit, cast spells etc. any attacks made against the trapped warrior are at +1 to hit.  <br/>A warrior can attempt to break the cage open if they are not adjacent to any monsters by rolling a strength check and scoring 6+rank or more. If successful the cage is ruined and the warrior is free. Note that a warrior doing this cannot attack this turn.  <br/>Alternatively the lock can be picked using lock picks in the usual way. <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| POISON CLOUD a random warrior sets of a trap that fills the room with a gust of poisonous gas. Every model on the board section loses wounds equal to the dungeon level with no modifiers and suffers -1 to hit this turn only.  <br/>Undead, daemons and skaven do not suffer these penalties. As this is poison damage warriors reduced to zero wounds will permanently lose 1 strength too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

In the power phase of each turn the trap fires into the same squares again until it rolls a double 1 or 2 for damage, when it runs out of fuel, or warriors leave the room.  <br/><br/>Roll 1D6 on a 1-3 draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| INSIDIOUS LAUGHTER: this trap hits all warriors on this board section, they are all doubled over with laughter and struggle to stop! From next turn each warrior must roll 1D6 and add their toughness needing to score 6+rank. If they fail they are at -1 to all die rolls that turn. If they pass then they control themselves that turn, but must roll again next turn. If they roll a natural 6 they shrug off the affect forever...until they meet this again!  <br/><br/>As long as any one warrior is affected by this laughter unexpected events occur on a roll of 1's and 2's.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| DARK MIST: this trap covers all the warriors in a dark mist, it lasts for the entire turn during which no combat or movement may occur. It dissipates in the next power phase. Then a random warrior (who set the trap off in the first place) finds that a random weapon of his is lost permanently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| DART HAIL: a random warrior sets of this trap and every model on that board section is peppered with tiny darts. They are all hit by D6 darts per level, each causing one wound. The total is modified as normal. Monsters are aware of the trap and so get hit by half this number.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| FIREBALL: a random warrior sets of this and is hit by a fireball causing D3 wounds per level ignoring all modifiers.

| PIT TRAP: this is a shallow pit trap and the warrior who falls in takes no damage. They will need to roll D6 plus strength and score 6+rank to climb out however. While in the pit they can make ranged attacks against adjacent enemies only and vice versa, they cannot make hand to hand attacks unless their weapon allows them to attack enemies 2 squares away.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| MEMORY ROBBING RAY: a random warrior sets of a magical trap that causes that warrior to forget things. For this turn the warrior may not act at all, monsters that attack are at +1 to hit him. Next turn the warrior may act again but has forgotten all spells and skills except those a level 1 warrior would have. A wizard will only know the spells he started with, if those have been changed in any way then he will know only the original spells, if any. Each turn the warrior remembers a number of skills or spells equal to half of the power roll rounding down until they are all remembered. (so no skills/spells on a 1, one on a 2-3, two on a 4-5 and three on a 6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ARROW TRAP: a random warrior sets off this trap and arrows fly from the walls into the room or corridor. All warriors in the affected area are attacked by arrows which cause 1D6 plus 1D6 damage per rank modified as normal. Monsters in the area avoid the trap entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| WALL SCYTHES: a random warrior sets off this trap and scything blades swing from a random wall which has no door in it. All models adjacent to that wall are attacked by multiple blades. The number of attacks is equal to their rank and hit on a 4+ each blade deals 3D6 + level damage modified as normal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| EXPLODING FLOOR TILE: a random warrior treads on a floor tile which explodes. The warrior takes 1D6 damage + 1D6 damage per rank modified as normal. All adjacent models take half this amount ignoring all modifiers. The warrior struck in this way is knocked prone taking a move to stand up again, while prone monsters have +1 to hit on any hand to hand attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| DUD TRAP: a random warrior sets off a trap and the whole party wait with baited breath, but nothing happens. The trap is an old trap and no longer works the way it should, however it does attract attention from monsters nearby. Roll on the monster table to see what shows up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| NOISY ALARM: a random warrior sets of this trap and the dungeon is filled with noise alerting any monsters nearby to the warriors presence. For the next 3 rooms monsters appear on a power roll of a 6 (treat as unexpected event but power roll remains a 6) and any monsters encountered other than unexpected events have Ambush 5+ ability, or +2 to any already existing Ambush ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| DELAYED TRAP: a random warrior sets off a trap but nothing happens: it's a dud trap! However it is not really, roll on trap table again in the next monster phase during combat and that trap is set off by whichever warrior set off this one. If no other combat occurs for any reason the warriors got off lightly this time! The roll should occur after monsters have appeared and made any attacks they are due to make.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| FIREBALL: random warrior sets off this fireball trap, the warrior and every adjacent model takes unmodified damage equal to their level. All models are also knocked prone taking their next move action to get up and granting hand to hand opponents a +1 to hit bonus upon them. The trap also makes a lot of noise: draw another event card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| SWINGING PENDULUM AXE: a random warrior sets off a trap which causes an oversized axe to swing down from above and smash into them before continuing to swing to and fro in this room/corridor. The warrior takes damage equal to 3D6 plus their level modified as normal. In the monster phase from now on before anything else happens the axe pendulum attacks every model in this square and those in line with it. Pendulums swing the 2 squares in a corridor and from door to door in a dungeon room or objective room. Attacks after the first one are treated as being with a WS equal to the level of the dungeon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| CONTINUAL HAIL OF DARTS: random warrior sets off this trap, for the the rest of the dungeon this trap is active in this room/corridor. In the power phase all models are attacked by the hail of darts. D6 darts per level strike all models causing 1 wound each with the total being modified as normal. Monsters are only hit by half this number. Roll once for all models in the room. If the room is revisited later in the adventure the trap is still going!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| SWINGING PINNING SPIKE TRAP: random warrior sets off this trap and part of the ceiling swings down impaling them onto spikes jutting out of the wall. The warrior takes 1D6 wounds with no modifier + their level. The warrior is also pinned to the wall until the other warriors can pull the trap off them. Each warrior that is adjacent and not pinned by a monster can help rolling 1D6 and adding their strength to the result, needing 18+2 per rank to be successful.  <br/><br/>Pinned warriors can fight as normal but are treated as pinned per the usual rules until the trap is pulled off and cannot move or make missile weapon attacks.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| STEAM JETS: random warrior sets off this trap which causes jets of steam to plume into the room/corridor. All warriors must roll 2D6 per rank and deduct their initiative and toughness from the result.

| WHOLE ROOM PIT TRAP: the entire room/corridor is a massive pit trap and a random warrior has set this off. Every occupied square becomes a pit models take 2d6 wounds per rank modified as normal but land on their feet. Pits are connected to other pits, but squares that have not collapsed have to be climbed to in the usual way, creating a fight on two levels. The squares that are not now pits do not collapse at all unless this event occurs again.  <br/><br/>This trap surprises even monsters who take full effect unless they are ethereal or flying enemies, in which case they can ignore the problem entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| BIG PIT TRAP: a random warrior sets off this trap, their square and every adjacent square collapses into a pit. Models in the pit can fight other models in the pit in the usual way. Combat between pit inhabitants and non-inhabitants can only be done through ranged attacks or spells.  <br/>Monsters are aware of this trap so take half the modified damage the warrior takes when he sets off the trap, this is 2D6 wounds per rank modified as normal.  <br/><br/>Draw another Event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| FORGOTTEN SKAVEN DEVICE: a random warrior sets off a forgotten skaven device here roll D6 to see what the device is:  <br/>1-2 cluster of Jezzails: warrior takes 1 hit per rank as though hit by a jezzail attack then no effect.  <br/>3 Warpfire thrower: warrior and adjacent squares takes 1 hit as per the warpfire thrower rules  <br/>4-5 censer bearer: warrior and adjacent squares affected by the censer bearer power for the rest of the encounter.  <br/>6 Warp lightning: warrior is struck by warp lightning taking 1D6 damage per rank with no modifiers and adjacent models take half this damage modified as normal.  <br/><br/>The warpfire thrower continues attacking the same squares until it misfires per the usual rules. The warp lightning attacks a random warrior every turn while there is a warrior in the room.  <br/><br/>Alternatively the warriors can stop these devices by entering a new room: attach the skaven objective room to the board wherever reasonable, this room has no inhabitants but the generator is powering the warplightning/warpfire trap and can be destroyed. It has toughness 5+rank and 10 wounds per level of dungeon. It's destruction attracts monsters (roll once on level table) but the room can be looted for a dungeon room item of treasure per warrior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| SHORT CUT PIT TRAP: the floor collapses inwards dumping the warriors into some kind of refuse pit, then hinges back upwards again. Each warrior takes D6 wounds per rank modified as normal. They are dumped into a mini dungeon which the current inhabitants of this dungeon know nothing about, there are D3+1 per rank cards in this dungeon and all must be explored in the normal way to get back to the room they fell through.  <br/><br/>Turns occur as normal here, if an event would occur simply roll straight on traps table for each one but you find treasure as though you'd defeated monsters each time also. There are never monsters or events in this mini-dungeon but treasure and traps are plentiful as this area is unexplored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| SPINNING BLADE TRAP: random warrior sets off this trap, metal blades shoot out of this square and hit all adjacent squares, the actual warrior setting this off is fine!

| REGENERATION TRAP: this trap is not set off by a warrior but merely in place on this room. There are monsters here who have learned to use latent magical energies to keep themselves alive. Roll on the monster table and these monsters have learned to use this room to gain regenerate a number of D6 equal to the rank of the warriors while they are in the room this stacks with any regeneration ability they normally have.  <br/><br/>Once these monsters are defeated the warriors gain no item of treasure for defeating them, but get gold as normal, but do manage to use the magic of the room to heal themselves all to full health before moving on.  <br/><br/>If this comes up in the objective room re-roll this trap. If any other monsters appear due to an Unexpected Event for example they do not have this regeneration ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

In a corridor all squares are affected and squares move one square clockwise in the same way.  <br/>In an objective room the outer squares act as above and the next squares inward move anti-clockwise in the same way  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| POSSESSION TRAP: a random warrior sets off this trap and becomes possessed! He immediately attacks the nearest warrior. This occurs for this turn only and the warrior uses no special skills apart from those that are “always on” or occur only on a to hit roll of 6 or similar.  <br/><br/>If the warrior drops the target to zero wounds he will continue attacking in the normal way if able to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| CONFUSION TRAP: a random warrior sets off this trap but it targets all warriors in the board section.

| FIREBALL: a random warrior sets off this and is hit by a fireball causing D3 wounds per level ignoring all modifiers. Every adjacent model takes half this number of wounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| LIGHTNING BOLT: random warrior is hit by a lightning bolt that causes D6 wounds + D6 per rank ignoring armor. After resolving this damage the warrior rolls a D6 on a 1-3 it bounces to the next nearest warrior. This continues until it has hit all warriors or a warrior rolls 4+.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| HINDERING BOLTS: a random warrior sets off this trap which causes a flurry of bolts to shoot from holes in the walls and attack all warriors on the board section. Warriors are attacked by D3 bolts per rank, each one hits automatically and cause total damage of D6 per bolt modified as normal for toughness and armor. (so hit by 3 bolts causes 3D6 wounds modified as normal). In addition the bolts have weights attached which cause warriors to be slowed down giving -1 movement until all monsters on the board have been defeated, if a warrior took no damage this does not affect them.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| PIT TRAP: this is a shallow pit trap and the warrior who falls in takes no damage. They will need to roll D6 plus strength and score 6+rank to climb out however. While in the pit they can make ranged attacks against adjacent enemies only and vice versa, they cannot make hand to hand attacks unless their weapon allows them to attack enemies 2 squares away.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| OILED FLOOR: a random warrior sets off his trap which causes oil to spray into the room and cover the floor with it's slippery flammable oiliness. While in this room warriors must pass an initiative check to move (D6 + initiative needing 6+rank to pass) otherwise they fall over for their move action. In addition if any fire based attacks are used (gunpowder, firebombs, breath weapons, spells etc) the entire room explodes dealing extra damage on top of whatever normal effect would be. This causes D6 per rank damage ignoring modifiers for armor.  <br/><br/>This also happens if the lantern bearer is reduced to zero wounds in the room as they fall over and drop the lantern.  <br/>Monsters are unaffected by the possibility of falling over but will be burned as normal.  <br/><br/>Draw another Event card immediately           |
| DEEP PIT TRAP: random warrior falls into an especially deep pit trap. They take 2D6 wounds per rank modified as normal but require two ropes or similar to get out. A single use of the levitate spell will still work however.  <br/>Due to the sheer number of bodies in the bottom of the pit the warrior may search for gold while down there.  <br/><br/>Draw another Event card immediately.      |
| FLAME JETS: a random warrior sets off this trap which causes flame jets to shoot out of the wall towards them. They and all models in that line (from side to side of room or corridor) are engulfed in flame causing D6 wounds per rank ignoring armor.  <br/>This effect then fires again every power phase on the same squares until the room is left. <br/><br/>Draw another Event card immediately.       |
| PORTCULLIS: a random warrior sets off this trap which causes a portcullis to drop down directly behind the warrior blocking off the dungeon behind them. This may divide the party and it requires two warriors to both pass a strength test in the same turn while there are no monsters on the board to lift it long enough for the other warriors to pass through. If it does not divide the party the warriors can simply continue. Any monsters appear this side of the new portcullis.  <br/><br/>Draw another Event card immediately.         |
| EXTRA DOORS TRAP: place two doors to either side of this room or corridor. A random warrior has set off this trap which causes these secret doors to suddenly open. Roll twice on the monster table to see what monsters appear in these rooms and place models immediately.  <br/>Normal gold is earned for defeating these monsters but no items of treasure.  <br/>The rooms are simple 4x4 dungeon rooms which are otherwise plain so no rules for those rooms apply in this instance.       |

If the bells are left on then a 1-3 in the power phase causes Unexpected Events instead for the rest of the adventure.              |
| FLAGSTONE TO CEILING: a random warrior sets off this trap and the flagstone they are standing on shoots up towards the ceiling. The warrior can avoid this by passing an initiative check needing 6+rank to avoid, if successful they move to an adjacent free square if there is one.  <br/><br/>If failed, or if there is no adjacent free square, they are pinned by the new pillar and the ceiling the attack causes 2D6 wounds +1D6 wounds per rank modified as normal.  <br/><br/>While pinned by the pillar the warrior can make no attacks as they are at ceiling level but they may use spells or blessings normally. Each turn they can attempt a strength check but it is hard to succeed requiring D6+ strength and scoring 8+rank to break free.  <br/><br/>Adjacent warriors can also attempt this check needing the same roll as long as they are not adjacent to monsters.  <br/>The square is no longer use able even when the warrior escapes the pillar remains.  <br/><br/>Draw another event card immediately.            |
| SPIKES FROM THE WALLS: a random warrior sets off this trap and spikes shoot out of the walls attacking any warriors adjacent to the walls.

Warriors must pass a strength test in order to move and can move 1 square for every point they score equal to or over the check which is 6+rank.  <br/><br/>While in the area warriors who are not halflings or dwarves also have -1 to attack rolls too.  <br/>Monsters in the area are used to this trap and have worked around it and are not hindered.      |
| ARROWS COMING OUT OF THE WALLS: a random warrior sets off this trap which causes a flurry of arrows to fly out and attack all of the warriors on this board section. 1D6 arrows are fired per rank of the warriors which are then evenly distributed amongst the warriors, any excess attacking the warrior who set off the trap. Each one hits on a roll of 4+ and causes D6 damage per rank modified as normal. Any skills to avoid hits can be used as normal.  <br/><br/>Monsters present are not affected as they know how to avoid this trap.             |
| CEILING SPIKES: a random warrior sets off this trap which causes long spikes to jab down from holes in the ceiling. The spikes attack the warrior who set off this trap and all squares in diagonal positions from that square on the same board section (so that in all 50% of the squares are attacked. Any model in those squares take D6 damage per rank modified as normal.  <br/><br/>The spikes attack every turn in the power phase until the warriors leave the room.  <br/><br/>Monsters are aware of this trap and so can try to avoid the trap on a roll of 4+ on a D6.           |
| LOVE TRAP: this bizarre trap is set off by a random warrior who promptly falls into a magically enchanted love for a creature present.  <br/>If there are only warriors present they fall in love with a random warrior. For the rest of this dungeon the “in love” warrior must get adjacent to the warrior they are in love with at all times or suffer -1 to hit.  Any monster that attacks the loved warrior has -1 to hit if the in love warrior is adjacent to the monster. The warrior has +1 to hit monsters that have attacked the loved warrior in it's previous turn. Once the dungeon is left the warrior shrugs off this effect and cannot remember the feeling at all, only the actions.  <br/><br/>If monsters are present the warrior falls in love with a random adjacent model. If this happens to be a monster the following occur:  <br/><br/>the warrior cannot attack the monster, even if the monster attacks them. Any adjacent warriors trying to attack the monster suffer -2 to hit the monster as the warrior tries to protect them.  <br/>If the warrior has any healing skills or spells they will use them on the monster ignoring rules that prevent use of these skills while monsters are on the same board section etc. so long as the monster is not on zero wounds.  <br/>When the monster eventually dies the warrior is so despondent that he suffers -1 to all attack rolls for the rest of the adventure or until 2 6's have been rolled in the power phase, once this happens the warrior is no longer affected and can remember nothing of his actions around the monster. |

| PIT TRAP LOOP: a random warrior sets off this trap which causes them to fall into a pit trap. However this is no normal pit trap, after falling some 20 feet the warrior falls from the ceiling of the room in sight of the warriors before falling again. This continues happening every turn and takes the warriors turn up.
