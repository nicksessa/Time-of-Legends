| dice: 2d6 | Type / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Never Yield - The knight must never give up once combat has begun. If the knight is defeated, he or she must either be killed or lose 2d6 VP for Yielding and breaking this Oath. The knight may, however, agree to stop a combat in progress due to a Combat Event, since this is not Yielding (see page 62). |
| 3 | Use no Weapons - The knight must fight barehanded.  Adjust his combat stats accordingly. |
| 4 | Always Help Ladies - Whenever the knight encounters a Lady, any of her Requests (such as for Aid or Escort) must be granted. When receiving a Message of Lady Summons, the knight must immediately travel to her Castle by the shortest route (if he serves a Lady). When hearing of an Adventure involving a Lady, the knight must pursue it. When hearing of an insult to a Lady, the knight must challenge the knight who insulted her. |
| 5 | Always Grant Requests - The knight must grant any requests for Aid (including Escorts) or Prayers made of him. |
| 6 | Fight Without Advantage - The knight must always fight chivalrously against Knightly opponents (see COMBAT: CHIVALRY, page 57). |
| 7 | Spare the Lives of Knights - The knight must not slay any Knights he defeats  |
| 8 | Serve Only Present Lord - The knight may never change Lords (thus, may never become an Arthurian Knight if not already one…). |
| 9 | Never Break Oaths - No Oaths sworn by the knight may be willingly broken. This Oath also protects the other Oaths: in order to be released from any Oath, the knight must first be released from this one. |
| 10 | Always Travel Alone - The knight may never have companions (a Dwarf, Mascot, or Man-at-Arms), nor may Escorts be performed; the knight will not permit others (comrades) to join him. |
| 11 | Do Not Eat - The knight must not eat anything. This will have the same effect as (but not the awards of) a Penance of fasting. This Oath may only be broken at the end of a turn. |
| 12 | Never Avoid Encounters - No Encounter may ever be avoided. The knight may not flee as a result of a Combat Event either |
^oaths


## Oaths
An Oath is an indicated course of action to which the knight must adhere.  Oaths may be forced on a knight by Knight’s Fate, by a Trick, as a result of meeting a Lady, King, or Hermit, or during a prison release.  The Oath should be noted on the knight’s Adventure Journal and erased once broken or removed.  Several Oaths may be sworn at one time.

## Breaking Oaths
If a sworn Oath is broken, the knight immediately loses 12 VP.  A knight may be Tricked (see Oaths table) into breaking an Oath.  A knight cannot break an Oath voluntarily unless he has enough VP to pay the penalty.

## Removing Oaths
An Oath may be removed without penalty by a Goodly Hermit Man, either through a Request or by obtaining a “release from oath/heal” reaction from him.  A Wood Nymph will also release a knight from any Oaths.

| dice: 2d6 | Type / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Abandon Lady (Lord) - The knight is tricked into abandoning his Lady (including an Enchantress), which results in the loss of 1d6 VP (2d6 VP if under Summons) and the Service Award. If the knight is not serving a Lady, the knight will abandon his Lord, for a loss of 1d6 VP (2d6 VP if under Summons). |
| 3 | Imprisonment - The knight is immediately imprisoned; a Castle is deployed on top of the knight if he is not already at one. No Appeal may be made to the Jailor (see Appeal to Jailor table). |
| 4 | Fight Enemy Unarmed - A random knight must be fought immediately by the unarmed knight. No combat awards are given, but the knight has a chance to request chivalrous combat. |
| 5 | Break (Swear) an Oath - One of the knight’s sworn Oaths must be broken (with the consequent VP loss). If no Oaths have been sworn, the knight must swear one. |
| 6 | Lose Horses - The knight is Tricked into giving away his horse (and that of his Dwarf, if applicable). |
| 7 | Tell a Lie - This most common Trick results in the knight telling a lie; however, only 1 VP is lost (instead of the normal 1d6 VP loss). |
| 8 | Fight an Enemy - A random knight must be fought by the knight, alone. The knight’s companions and comrades may not aid in the combat. If the knight is defeated, he will suffer Knight’s Fate. |
| 9 | Lose Lance - The knight is Tricked into giving away his lance (plus the extra one, if applicable). |
| 10 | Escort Pilgrims - As if a Penance, the knight must Escort Pilgrims (see Requests table) by the shortest path to a randomly determined Shrine (see Shrine table). No awards are given for completing the Escort. If the knight refuses or if a detour is made, the knight loses 2d6 VP. |
| 11 | Deliver a Message - The knight must immediately travel to a randomly determined royal Castle, and must obtain a friendly Castle reaction to deliver a message. The knight will receive no awards for completing the task, and will lose 2d6 VP for detouring or refusing the task. The exact message need not be determined. |
| 12 | Prophecy - A randomly determined Adventure is given to the knight as a Prophecy. The knight will receive awards for the performance of the Adventure. |

## Tricks
An encountered person may attempt to Trick a knight.  The knight may attempt to escape a Trick (Luck Test).  If a knight successfully escapes a Hermit’s Trick, the knight will gain 1d6 VP; this is the only case where an award results from escaping a Trick.  If the attempt fails, the knight loses 1d6 VP and the Trick is randomly determined.
