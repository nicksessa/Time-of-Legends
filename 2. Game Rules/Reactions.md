## King Arthur 
(or whoever is the High King or Emperor or Pope, etc.)

| King Arthur Reaction                       |
| ------------------------------------------ |
| `dice: [[Reactions#^KingArthurReactions]]` | 


| dice: 2d6 | Reaction / Description |
| :---:|---|
| 2 | *Exiles* - King Arthur refuses the Request. The PK is immediately thrown out of Camelot Castle, and exiled from Jagent castellany (Logres 1). In order to approach King Arthur again, the PK will have to absorb the 12 VP loss for violating the exile, or meet him outside of Jagent castellany |
| 3 | *Task: Slay Monster* - King Arthur does not grant the Request, but gives the PK the Task of finding and slaying a randomly deployed Monster. If the PK succeeds, he will gain +2 on further King Arthur reactions. |
| 4 | *Task: Adventure* - King Arthur does not grant the Request (unless the Request was for an Adventure!), but sends the PK on an Adventure. If the PK has no Men-at-Arms, King Arthur immediately assigns him one Arthurian Knight as a Man-at-Arms. When rolling for the Adventure, add +1 to each die (treat any 7 as a 6). If the PK succeeds (and the Request was not for an Adventure), he will receive +1 on further King Arthur reactions. |
| 5 | *Task: Mad Knight* - King Arthur does not grant the Request, but gives the PK the Task of retrieving a Mad Knight (Adventure 5:3). If the PK succeeds, he will gain +1 on further King Arthur reactions. |
| 6 | *Doubts PK’s Honor* - The PK makes a poor impression on King Arthur, who does not grant the Request and casts doubts on the PK’s honor. The PK loses 6 VP, but may remain in Camelot Castle. The PK may make a Request of King Arthur on the next turn. |
| 7 | *Task: Joust 3 Knights* - King Arthur gives the PK the Task of defeating three Arthurian NPKs in tournament-style combat. If the PK is successful, King Arthur will be friendly and grant the Request. If the PK is defeated, King Arthur will assign a Knight’s Fate. (Reroll if impossible, e.g. if the PK is currently enchanted into Animal form) |
| 8 | *Task: Deliver Message* - King Arthur gives the PK the Task of delivering a message to a random Kingdom by the most direct route (reroll any Logres Castellanies). A friendly reaction must be obtained from the royal Castle to deliver the message. If the Task is successfully completed, King Arthur will grant the Request upon the PK’s return. The exact message need not be determined. |
| 9 | *Task: Slay Brigands* - King Arthur gives the PK the Task of vanquishing Brigands (see Adventures table, Adventure 2:4). If the Task is successfully completed, King Arthur will grant the Request upon the PK’s return. |
| 10 | *Task: Attend Court* - The friendly King Arthur will grant the Request if the PK will attend an upcoming court ceremony at Camelot Castle. To perform this Task, the PK must lose two turns. |
| 11 | *Task: Attend Feast* - King Arthur will grant the Request if the PK will join in a feast and celebration. To do so, the PK must lose one turn. |
| 12 | *Grants Request* - King Arthur grants the PK’s Request. |
^KingArthurReactions

### Refusing Arthur’s Tasks
A PK may not refuse a Task and must attempt to complete it.

### Fulfilling Arthur’s Tasks
If the Task has been successfully completed, Camelot Castle will be (temporarily) friendly upon his return and the PK will gain a cumulative +1 (or +2, in the case of the Slay Monster Task) on further King Arthur reactions.

### Failing Arthur’s Tasks
If the PK fails to complete the Task, Camelot Castle will not be friendly (unless already permanently so) and a new Castle reaction must be determined before the PK can approach King Arthur again.

### Requesting to Become an Arthurian Knight
If a PK Requests to become an Arthurian Knight before earning 100 CP or with a VL of 6 or greater, King Arthur’s reaction will automatically be “2: Exiles”


## Castle Reactions

| Castle Reaction                        |
| -------------------------------------- |
| `dice: [[Reactions#^CastleReactions]]` | 


| dice: 2d6 | Reaction / Description |
|---|------|
| 2 | Monster Attacks - A randomly drawn Monster lurking in the shadow of the Castle attacks the PK. The PK may attempt to avoid the Monster. If the Monster is defeated, the Castle will become friendly; otherwise, the Castle remains unfriendly. If a Monster is not avoided (Luck Test), it will always attack immediately, and will slay the PK if victorious. Monsters use three attack dice and ignore all “opponent” Combat Events  |
| 3 | Knights Attack (1d6) - A group of 1–6 Knights sorties from the Castle and attacks the PK. If the Castle is Camelot, the Knights must all be Arthurian. If all of the Knights are defeated, the Castle will become friendly; otherwise, the Castle remains unfriendly. If the PK is defeated, he is subject to a Knight’s Fate. |
| 4 | Tricks - This Trick (see Tricks table) may be escaped (Luck Test), but the Castle will remain unfriendly regardless of the outcome. |
| 5 | Gives a Message - The unfriendly Castle gives the PK a randomly determined Message (see Messages table). |
| 6 | Tests Virtue - The Castle owner demands of those who would gain entrance that they prove their worthiness by completing a VL Test. If the PK succeeds, he will gain the friendship of the Castle. If the PK fails or refuses to try, he loses 3 VP and will be refused entrance; the PK must then leave the Castle and return to the countryside to roll for an encounter before returning to the Castle and rolling Castle reaction again. |
| 7 | Lord not Home - The Castle owner is not currently in residence and the guards will not permit the PK to enter or resupply. The Castle is neutral. |
| 8 | Offers Challenge - The Castle’s champion (a randomly drawn Knight; redraw if he has already challenged or been challenged by the PK; if the Castle is Camelot, the champion must be Arthurian) is sent forth and offers a challenge to the PK (see page 63). If the PK accepts and is victorious, the Castle will become friendly; otherwise, the Castle remains neutral. |
| 9 | Informs of Adventure - The Castle is friendly and invites the PK and his party in. The PK is told of a randomly determined Adventure (see Adventures table). If the Adventure is not pursued immediately, it will disappear. |
| 10 | Offers Friendship - The friendly Castle invites the PK to enter and restock equipment. |
| 11 | Offers Adventure - The Castle is friendly. A randomly determined Adventure (reroll a 5:6 TOURNAMENT AT CAMELOT result or a 2:2 VISIT LOCAL KING result if already at the local royal Castle) is about to be pursued by 1–6 of the castle’s NPKs (if the Castle is Camelot, they must all be Arthurian). The PK is invited to lead the party; the offer may be accepted or declined without penalty or change in Castle reaction. The Castle Knights are comrades and their retention must be checked at the end of each turn. |
| 12 | Shows Magic Gateway - The friendly Castle offers to let the PK use a magic gateway to Faerie (see page 69). If the offer is accepted, the PK may move there on the next turn. |

### Castle Encounters
A Castle is the abode and stronghold of some person of importance and is located within a Kingdom in a countryside, in a forest, on a river, or even in a wasteland. A Castle owner may be a King, Lady, or Knight (including a PK). A PK starts play in his Lord’s Castle. That Castle will remain friendly to the PK until the PK leaves the service of the Lord. The Castle of the PK’s Lady is also friendly, as is the PK’s own Castle once he is granted one. Other castles may become friendly as a result of their reaction or their owner’s reaction (e.g. King’s reactions 8 and 10) and in some other circumstances (e.g. Knight’s Fate 8).

Encountering a Castle is a voluntary decision on the PK’s part, so he cannot “avoid” the Castle. If a friendly reaction is not received, the PK must remain outside the Castle (he is still at the castle, not in the surrounding encounter area). If the PK tries repeatedly to obtain a friendly Castle reaction, apply +1 to the roll for each turn of persistence

### Friendly Castles
Entering a friendly Castle requires no Castle reaction roll. A friendly Castle will automatically resupply a PK with equipment, including any equipment his Dwarf might be carrying—unless the PK is without a Lord, in which case he will be given a sword and nothing else (his Dwarf will be ignored). A Castle remains friendly until its owner is slain or the PK is outlawed from that Castle. The location (and name, if a royal Castle) of each friendly Castle should be noted on the PK’s Adventure Journal.

No encounters will occur while at a friendly Castle, nor will the PK’s comrades leave (the PK need not check to retain them while at a friendly Castle). The owner of a friendly Castle is also automatically friendly, which means the PK may make Requests of him or her: an audience with the owner is assumed to be granted. However, if the Castle owner is a Lady and the PK wishes to Request entering her
service, her reaction must first be determined (see Lady Reactions table).

When PKs are traveling in a party, the Castle will be considered friendly to the party if the Castle is friendly to one of the PKs. This enables the party to be re-equipped at the Castle. However, the other PKs will not be able to make Requests of the owner, and the Castle will not be friendly to these PKs once the party leaves the Castle. The Castle may become friendly to these PKs on a permanent basis if the friendly PK successfully Requests friendship for each of them. This does not apply to Camelot Castle: being in the company of an Arthurian PK or NPK does not make Camelot Castle friendly.

### Player Knight Castles
PKs may find it advantageous to Request a Castle of their Lord. Their own Castle will always be friendly, a place to resupply equipment and a refuge from harassing PKs. Here too a PK may send any defeated PKs for imprisonment to delay them in the game (see Imprisonment table). However, the PK will lose 3 VP per imprisoned PK every turn. If another PK visits the Castle, the Castle reaction will be an automatic “Lord not Home” if the owner is elsewhere, though he can storm the Castle if prisoners are held within, thus freeing them (this is Aid rendered). When first granted by one’s Lord, the Castle’s garrison consists of a single randomly-drawn NPK (nonArthurian, unless the Lord is King Arthur).

To further arm his Castle, a PK may send any personally defeated Knights to guard it. The PK may not have more than 6 guards at one time or replace Knights already guarding the Castle with ones defeated later. NPK guards will not leave the Castle; a PK guard can leave by breaking his word (which costs him 12 VP). On his turn, a PK on guard duty rolls for an encounter using the Castle’s encounter area chart (countryside, forest, river, or wasteland); his party size is the number of guards at the castle. Reroll a “Flooded River”, “Lady Bathing”, or “Wood Nymph” encounter. Treat a “Lost” forest encounter as 1–6 Knights. Most encounters can be ignored by remaining inside the Castle walls; attacking Knights and Kings will storm the Castle.

Finally, a PK may move his Lady to his own Castle (treat as a Request for Escort, Requests table) to make her immune to imprisonment
by a Message.

### Camelot Castle
Camelot Castle is a special case. Any friendly reaction will be temporary, Camelot reverting to neutral as soon as the PK leaves it. If the PK obtains a friendly reaction when encountering King Arthur or when Requesting something from King Arthur, Camelot Castle becomes permanently friendly

## Animal Reactions

| Animal Reaction                        |
| -------------------------------------- |
| `dice: [[Reactions#^animalReactions]]` | 


| dice: 2d6 | Reaction / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Attacks with Other (1d6) - The Animal plus 1–6 others of the same type attack the PK. |
| 3 | Attacks Steed - The Animal attacks the PK’s horse, if he has one, or else it attacks the PK. The horse may be slain by Combat Event or if the Animal inflicts 3 wounds. The PK may fight for his horse, but the horse does not fight. Should the Animal slay the PK’s mount, it will then attack the PK. |
| 4 | Speaks Prophecy - A randomly determined Adventure (see Adventures Table) is assigned to the PK as a Prophecy. |
| 5 | Gives Message - A randomly determined Message (see Messages table) is given to the PK by the Animal. |
| 6 | Flees, Chased by a Knight - The Animal flees, but a randomly determined Knight arrives. When determining the Knight’s reaction, subtract 1 from the reaction roll. |
| 7 | Runs Away - The Animal flees. The PK may attempt to pursue the Animal (Luck Test). If followed, the Animal’s reaction is redetermined. |
| 8 | Leads to Local Adventure - If the PK chooses to follow the Animal, it will lead him next turn to a randomly determined local Adventure (rerolling any 5:6 TOURNAMENT AT CAMELOT or specifically non-local result, such as “Go to Rome”). If the PK chooses not to follow the Animal, nothing happens. |
| 9 | Informs of Adventure - The Animal speaks and informs the PK of a randomly determined Adventure. If the Adventure is not pursued immediately, it disappears. |
| 10 | Stays as Mascot - The Animal joins the PK’s party as a Mascot. If the PK already has one, the encountered Animal will attack that Mascot. If the Animal is victorious, it will then attack the PK. |
| 11 | Is an Enchanted Lady - The animal explains that it is an Enchanted Lady, and appeals to the PK for a prayer to end the Enchantment. This is a Request for Aid, and 6 VP will be gained or lost accordingly (a failed prayer yields no reward nor penalty). If the Enchantment is lifted, the revealed Lady (redraw any Enchantress) will be friendly, otherwise the Animal will leave. |
| 12 | Leads to Local Friendly Castle - If the PK chooses to follow the Animal, it will lead him next turn to a friendly Castle in the local countryside. The Castle’s owner is a Lady; her reaction must be determined if the PK wants to Request to enter her service. |

## Dwarf Reactions

| Dwarf Reactions                        |
| ------------------------------------- |
| `dice: [[Reactions#^dwarfReactions]]` | 


| dice: 2d6 | Reaction / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Tricks into Faerie - The PK is tricked into going to Faerie (see page 69). The normal 12 VP or CP award for arriving there is not given. |
| 3 | Calls King and Knights - A randomly drawn King arrives. The number of Knights in the King’s escort is equal to the number of Knights in the PK’s party (counting the PK). When rolling the King’s reaction, subtract 1 from the result. |
| 4 | Calls Brigands - The Dwarf calls 6 Brigands to attack the PK and his party. Brigands are highwaymen and scoundrels who terrorize travelers and common folk. Only a Knight’s long lance and sharp sword can stand against these villains and make the countryside safe. If a PK does not avoid encountered Brigands, they will always attack immediately. A Brigand has 2 attack dice. If Brigands are victorious in combat, they will rob the PK and his party of all equipment. |
| 5 | Tricks - The Dwarf attempts to trick the PK. The PK may escape the Trick (Luck Test). If unsuccessful, the type of Trick is randomly determined (see Tricks table). |
| 6 | Gives Message - A randomly determined Message (see Messages table) is given to the PK by the encountered Dwarf. |
| 7 | Offers Equipment - The encountered Dwarf is on horseback, carrying a full set of equipment, and offers to resupply the PK. Note that this is the only case (other than in a castle) where an encountered Dwarf is carrying equipment. The Dwarf’s reaction is neutral, not friendly, and he will not accompany the PK. If attacked, he fights at +1 as long as he is on horseback. |
| 8 | Requests Aid - The Dwarf Requests Aid (see Aid Request table). If the Aid is granted, he will be friendly. |
| 9 | Informs of Adventure - The friendly Dwarf tells the PK of a randomly determined Adventure (see Adventures table). If the Adventure is not pursued immediately, it disappears. |
| 10 | Requests to Join - The friendly Dwarf Requests to serve the PK. If the PK has no Dwarf, he will join, but has no extra equipment. If the PK already has a Dwarf, the two Dwarves will attack each other. Any Dwarf defeated in combat is slain. If the encountered Dwarf is victorious, he will then attack the PK. |
| 11 | Is Knight in Disguise - The Dwarf is actually a (randomly drawn) Knight in disguise. When determining the Knight’s reaction, add 1 to the result. |
| 12 | Leads to Local Castle - The Dwarf is friendly. If the PK wishes, on the next turn, the Dwarf will escort him to a local friendly Castle. The Castle owner is a Lady; her reaction must be determined if the PK wishes to Request entering her service (see Lady Reactions table). |
^dwarfReactions


### Encountering Dwarves
A Dwarf is a diminutive manservant common in Arthurian legends. If an encountered Dwarf is not avoided, his reaction must be randomly determined. All encountered Dwarves have 1 WL (as noted on the chit), and use two attack dice.

| dice: 2d6 | Reaction / Description** |

| 7 | Requests Services - The Goodly Hermit Man requests services. The PK may decline and be on his way without penalty (but the Hermit will be neutral).

The Hermit will be friendly at the end of that turn’s services. |
| 8 | Informs of Adventure - The friendly Hermit tells the PK of a randomly determined Adventure. If the Adventure is not pursued immediately, it disappears. |

| 10 | Penance: Fast - A Penance of fasting is assigned by the friendly Hermit. The PK may go without food for up to six turns, beginning with the next turn. While fasting, the PK must divide all of his combat rolls in half, rounding down. For each turn spent fasting, the PK gains 3 VP. At the end of any turn, the PK may declare the fast at an end, and resume full combat ability on the next turn. At least one turn must be spent fasting to perform the Penance. If the PK turns down the Penance, the Hermit will be neutral. |
| 11 | Penance: Pilgrimage - A Pilgrimage to a randomly determined Shrine of Britain (see Shrine table) is assigned to the PK by the friendly Hermit. If the PK makes any detours along the way, this Penance has been refused. Upon arriving at the Shrine, the PK gains 12 VP. |
| 12 | Heals / Removes Oath - The friendly Hermit offers to either remove one Oath the PK has sworn (without penalty to the PK), remove any one Enchantment currently in effect, release the PK from an Enchantress’s service (including Morgan’s), or cure all of the PK’s Poisoned Wounds. The PK chooses. |
^goodHermit



### Encountering Goodly Hermits

A Goodly Hermit Man is a reclusive, wandering priest of nature. If a PK does not avoid him (Luck Test), his reaction is randomly determined. All Hermits have a WL of 1 and use one attack die (though they never initiate combat). If a Goodly Hermit Man assigns a Penance, the PK will gain the VP indicated for performing the Penance, or will lose 12 VP for refusing it.

If the PK declines, the PK’s comrades and companions (Men-at-Arms and Dwarf but not Mascot) will abandon him. The PK is supplied with a lance and shield (from the King’s escort) if missing either one (in a wasteland, the PK will be supplied with a sword and shield). If the PK is victorious, the King becomes friendly. If the PK is defeated, he will suffer Knight’s Fate and the King remains neutral. If the challenge is inconclusive, the King also remains neutral but no Knight’s Fate is suffered by the PK. |
| 6 | Offers a Challenge - The King offers a challenge to the PK. The PK may accept or decline the offer without penalty. If the PK declines the offer, the (neutral) King’s party will depart. Otherwise resolve as in reaction 5. |

^kingReactions


### The King’s Guard
A King is a ruler of one of the Kingdoms depicted on the map. A King is always accompanied by as many Knights as there are in the PK’s party (counting the PK). If the King is Arthur, the Knights in his escort must all be Arthurian. A King’s escort is always retained: do not check for retention (see page 20).

### The King’s Reaction
The King’s reaction represents the entire party’s reaction. If a PK does not avoid an encountered King (Luck Test), the King’s reaction must be randomly determined, unless he is the PK’s Lord.

If the King’s reaction is friendly (8–12), once it has been resolved the PK may challenge him if eligible (see page 63). The PK must fight chivalrously while the King may do so (VL Check of his VL). If the King wins the challenge, the PK suffers Knight’s Fate.

## Knight Reactions

| 3 | Fight for Lady - The encountered Knights attack the PK. If the PK’s side loses, the PK will suffer the loss of his Lady (if applicable) in addition to a normal Knight’s Fate. The Service Award is lost, but there is no VP loss unless the PK was under Summons (6 VP in that case). |
| 4 | Refuse to Fight - The encountered Knights are disdainful, and refuse any challenge, and will not join the PK nor permit the PK to join them. The PK’s honor is tarnished and he loses 3 VP. No CP will be awarded if combat is forced on them (but VP will) |
| 5 | Trick - The opponent Knights try to Trick the PK (see Oaths table). The PK may attempt to escape the Trick (Luck Test); if unsuccessful, randomly determine the Trick. |
| 6 | Attack - The PK and his party are attacked by the Knights. The PK may attempt to flee (Luck Test) before the combat. If defeated, the PK will suffer Knight’s Fate. |
| 7 | Offer Challenge - The (neutral) Knights’ leader (the first drawn) offers a challenge (see page 63), which may be accepted or declined without penalty to the PK.

^knightReactions


### Encountering Knights

Whenever a PK encounters Knights with a leader (a King or Lady), the leader’s reaction takes precedence (the Knights’ reaction is not checked). If the Knights are not accompanying a King or Lady, then their reaction is randomly determined.

If the Knights’ reaction is friendly (8–11), once it has been resolved the PK may challenge their leader (the first-drawn Knight) if eligible (see page 63). The PK must fight chivalrously while the NPKs may do so (VL Check of their VL).

## Lady Reactions

| Lady Reactions                       |
| ------------------------------------ |
| `dice: [[Reactions#^ladyReactions]]` | 


| dice: 2d6 | Reaction / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Attempts Suicide - `dice: [[Reactions#^despairTable]]` The Lady is despondent and attempts suicide. The attempt may be prevented if the PK makes a successful Luck Test; if saved, the Lady will immediately become friendly and the PK gains 6 VP for rendering Aid. If the Luck Test is not successful, the Lady dies and her card is removed from the deck. |
| 3 | Exacts an Oath - The PK is forced to swear an Oath (see Oaths table) |
| 4 | Tricks - The Lady attempts to Trick the PK (see Oaths table). The PK may attempt to escape the Trick (Luck Test); if unsuccessful, randomly determine the Trick. |

| 6 | Seduces - `dice: [[Reactions#^seductionTable]]` The Lady attempts to seduce the PK. Seduction is resolved by a VL Check against his VL plus the Lady’s Seduction Adjustment. If successful, the seduction fails. A seduced PK gains the seductress’s service award but loses VP equal to the Lady’s VL. If the PK was already serving a Lady, the previous Lady’s service award is lost. If this occurs while the PK was under his Lady’s Summons, he loses another 6 VP. If two PKs are simultaneously seduced by the same Lady, they immediately fight. The winner takes the Lady and the loser takes the consequences. |
| 7 | Informs of Adventure - The (neutral) Lady tells the PK of a randomly determined Adventure (see Adventures table). If the Adventure is not pursued immediately, it disappears. |
| 8 | Requests Escort - The friendly Lady Requests that the PK accompany her to a randomly determined Town, Port, or Shrine (randomly determine a Kingdom; if Strangore or Logres is indicated, the destination is London; if Lothian, St. Andrew; if Benwick, Barflete). If the destination is a Castle (e.g. Carbonek, Tintagel, Howel, etc.), it is not friendly. The requested escort (see Requests table) is treated as Aid: 6 VP are gained for performing it, or lost for refusing it. If not escorted, the Lady will not remain friendly. |
| 9 | Requests Aid - The Lady Requests randomly determined Aid (see Aid Request table). If the Aid is granted, she will be friendly. |
| 10 | Invites to Castle - The PK is asked to accompany the friendly Lady to her Home Castle. The invitation may be accepted or declined at no penalty to the PK; even if declined, the Lady (and her Castle) will remain friendly. |
| 11 | Gives a Message - The friendly Lady gives the PK a randomly determined Message (see Messages table). |
| 12 | Offers Her Hand - The friendly Lady offers to admit the PK into her service. If the PK is already serving a Lady, he must decline. |

### Encountering Ladies
A Lady is a woman of relatively noble birth, owner of a Castle. A Lady’s Castle (if relevant) is deployed randomly, unless specified as being local. All Ladies have a WL of 1 and use one attack die (though they rarely do so).

If a PK encounters a Lady outside of her Castle, roll one die to determine her status: if the result is 1–3, that number of admiring Knights are with the Lady. If the result is 4–5, the Lady is alone. On a result of 6, however, the Lady is being distressed by one NPK (redraw until the NPK’s VL is 6 or worse), who will be unfriendly towards the PK; the Lady’s reaction will be to request Aid (a rescue from her captor). She will become friendly if her captor is defeated.

If alone with a friendly Lady, a PK may try to court her (Request to enter her service); a Lady may not be courted until all her party is defeated. If a PK is already in service to the Lady, he may ask her for a Token (see Requests table).

**Enchantresses:** Certain Ladies are Enchantresses (witches). When an Enchantress is encountered, her reaction (whether accompanied or not) will automatically be to Enchant the PK (see Enchantments table); no reaction roll is needed. If the PK resists the Enchantment (VL Check), the Enchantress will not be friendly.

| dice: 2d6 | Reaction / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Magic Shield (-2) - Each fight round, the Magic Shield absorbs the wielder’s first 2 wounds. If broken as a result of a Combat Event, it absorbs just 1 wound, and becomes a normal shield upon breaking a second time. |
| 3 | Magic Ring - The PK can become invisible to automatically avoid an encounter (including one with Merlin/Morgan). However, doing so causes the loss of all comrades and companions (except a Mascot) and costs him 6 VP (corruption). |
| 4 | Lucky Charm - The PK rolls two dice and chooses one when rolling for his Luck-of-the-Day. |
| 5 | Faithful Dwarf - The PK gains a faithful Arthurian Dwarf who will not abandon him if he is defeated in combat (see Dwarf Reactions table). |
| 6-8 | Magic Talisman - The wearer may add +2 to his dice when attempting to resist Enchantment. |
| 9 | Valiant Charger - The PK is given a horse which may travel 4 encounter areas per turn (3 if carrying two people) and gives the PK +1 on combat rolls when he is on horseback. The Valiant Charger has WL 3+d3 and takes a wound every time it would be killed by a Combat Event; it will also fight for the PK, should he be defeated. |
| 10 | Magic Girdle - The wearer's WL is increased by +5. |
| 11 | Unbreakable Lance - This weapon does not break in combat. |
| 12 | Magic Sword +4 - If broken as a result of a Combat Event, it loses one pip of bonus, becoming a normal sword upon reaching +0 |

## Morgan Le Fay Reaction

Whenever Morgan encounters a PK, her reaction will be to Enchant him (Morgan’s Seduction Adjustment is +5; see Enchantments table). If the PK fails to resist the Enchantment (VL Check against the PK’s VL+5) and Morgan chooses to “Seduce”, the PK must abandon any Lady he serves (with the usual CP and VP consequences) and enter Morgan’s service (her Service Award is 30). The PK loses 12 VP when seduced by Morgan.

If the PK receives a Summons from her while in her service, he is magically transported to wherever Morgan is (if he was imprisoned, the Summons takes him out of prison), loses another 6 VP, and is subject to another Enchantment attempt (treating “Seduce” as “nothing happens”).

A Goodly Hermit Man or Wood Nymph may lift Morgan’s spell of service.


## Imprisonment - Appeals to Passerby

| Prison Appeal to Passerby                     |
| --------------------------------------------- |
| `dice: [[Reactions#^prisonAppealToPasserby]]` | 


| dice: 2d6 | Type / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Must abandon Lady (Lord) - The passerby will make an Appeal to Jailor if the PK will abandon his Lady, suffering any penalties that accrue thereby. If the PK serves no Lady, his Lord must be abandoned. Note that the PK must do this before the Appeal to Jailor is attempted. |
| 3 | Must Swear an Oath if Released - If released as the result of a passerby’s Appeal to Jailor, the PK must immediately swear an Oath (see Oaths table). |
| 4 | Must Fight an Enemy After Release - If released, the PK must immediately fight a random NPK. Any Equipment the PK possessed when imprisoned will be returned before the combat. The PK may request that the opponent fight chivalrously (see page 57). |
| 5 | Must attempt a Prison Rescue if Released - If released, the PK must go to a randomly deployed Castle and attempt to free an imprisoned NPK from that Castle. Three unsuccessful Appeals to Jailor or one Storm the Castle constitute a valid attempt at rescue. |
| 6-8 | Passerby Ignores Prisoner (reroll once if persisting) - The appeal to the passerby is ignored. If the PK was persisting, reroll (no more than once per turn). |
| 9 | Must Deliver a Message if Released - If released, the PK must immediately deliver a message to a randomly determined royal Castle. The message cannot be delivered until a friendly Castle reaction is received. The exact message need not be determined. |
| 10 | Must Escort Pilgrims if Released - The PK, if released, must immediately Escort Pilgrims (see Requests table) to a randomly determined Shrine (see Shrine table), but will receive no awards for the Escort. The PK may not detour nor ignore the Escort. |
| 11 | Must Attempt an Adventure if Released - A randomly determined Adventure (rerolling any 5:6 TOURNAMENT AT CAMELOT or local result) must be performed by the PK at some time after the release from prison (as if a Prophecy). No adventure awards will be gained. |
| 12 | Passerby will Make a Free Appeal to Jailor - The passerby agrees to Appeal to Jailor at no cost. |
^prisonAppealToPasserby

### Imprisonment
A PK may be imprisoned (thrown into a cell within a Castle or Town Jail) by Knight’s Fate, Trick, Enchantment, or by Town Watchmen. An imprisoned PK immediately loses all equipment, companions, and comrades. A PK may make one Appeal per turn. If imprisoned by a King, the PK may make a direct Appeal to Jailor; if imprisoned by another PK, the jailor PK can choose to let the prisoner make a direct Appeal to Jailor; otherwise, the PK may only Appeal to a Passerby. If the passerby agrees to help, and if the terms are satisfactory to the PK, the PK immediately resolves the Appeal to Jailor. A PK making the same appeal twice in a row is persisting, which allows a reroll when the appeal is ignored.

### Rescuing a Prisoner
A PK might pursue an Adventure involving the rescue of an imprisoned person. Upon arriving at the imprisoning castle, the PK may either Appeal to Jailor or Storm the Castle. To Appeal to Jailor, the PK must first resolve a Castle reaction. If it is friendly, the PK may make the Appeal. To Storm the Castle, the PK’s party must defeat 1–6 Knights; if defeated, the PK is imprisoned. PK Castles garrison’s are determined differently (see Castle Reactions table).

### Player Knight Jailors
If a PK is the owner of a Castle, any Knight he defeats (PK or NPK) may be imprisoned in that Castle or sent to that Castle as a guard. The Castle owner must abide by the results of any Appeal to Jailor (whether on behalf of a PK or NPK) made by a PK or a passerby. The Jailor loses 3 VP per imprisoned PK, every turn.
