| dice: 2d6 | Type / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Lady (Lord) is Imprisoned - This Message should be treated as a Lady Summons. If the PK does not serve a Lady, then the Summons is from his Lord. If the Summons is not answered before the PK receives a second Summons, he will suffer the appropriate consequences. When the PK returns to the appropriate castle, he will find the castle to be unfriendly, with 1–6 Knights in control, and his Lady or Lord imprisoned. The PK must storm the Castle (attack the Knights in control and defeat them) in order to free his Lady or Lord. The Summons cannot be answered until his Lady or Lord is freed. |
| 3 | Relative Near Death- Go Home Swiftly - This Message must be answered at once, by returning to the PK’s original (start of game) Home Castle by the shortest route possible. The Castle will be at least temporarily friendly. There, the PK’s relative has taken violently ill and awaits death. The PK must remain at his side Praying for his health or until death claims the relative. The PK Prays each turn, and if successful (earning the usual 6 VP for Aid rendered) he may return to adventuring. If by the third turn of Praying the PK is still unsuccessful, the relative dies, freeing the PK from his long vigil. |
| 4 | PK is Outlawed from a Friendly Castle - The PK has just received word that he has been outlawed by a friendly Castle, meaning the Castle is now neutral. The PK may choose which of the friendly Castles has outlawed him, but the PK’s Lord’s Castle will not outlaw the PK (nor will the PK’s own Castle). If the PK has no eligible friendly Castles, roll for another Message. |
| 5 | Wedding of State - The PK has just been informed of a Wedding of State that duty demands he must attend. The wedding is to be held in a randomly deployed Castle. The PK must proceed by the shortest path to that Castle; it will be temporarily friendly. After the wedding, which consumes a turn, the PK may approach the Castle’s Lord and make a Request. The PK receives 3 VP for attending the wedding. If the PK refuses to attend, he loses 6 VP. |
| 6 | Lady’s Virtue is Challenged - The PK hears of an insult made to his Lady. The PK may challenge the random Knight who made the insult (redraw until the Knight has a VL of 6 or worse, unless the PK’s Lady is an Enchantress; also redraw if this Knight has already challenged or been challenged by the PK) for the Lady’s honor. A PK in the service of an Enchantress may not ignore the insult. If the PK ignores the insult or loses the challenge, then his Lady releases him from her service and he loses the Service Award in CP (and another 6 VP if under Summons). If the PK is victorious he receives 6 VP. If the PK has no Lady, he may challenge the Knight. If he wins, the randomly drawn Lady will automatically be friendly when he visits her Castle. If she turns out to be an Enchantress, she will instead try to Enchant him (see Enchantments table). |
| 7 | Lord Summons - The PK has received a Summons from his Lord (note this on his Adventure Journal). The summons need not be answered immediately, but if the PK receives another Summons before the first is answered, he loses 6 VP. This loss can be repeated until he answers the Summons. To do so, the PK must return to his Lord’s Castle. |
| 8 | Lady Summons - If the PK serves a Lady, he has received a Summons from her (note this on his Adventure Journal). If no Lady is served, the Summons may be ignored. The Summons need not be answered immediately, but if the PK does not reach his Lady before she sends a second one, she will die of loneliness! The PK loses her Service Award and 12 VP. Additionally, he goes mad on a die roll of 1 (see page 12). |
| 9 | Informed of an Adventure - The PK is told of a randomly determined Adventure (see Adventures table). If the Adventure is not pursued immediately, it disappears. |
| 10 | Raiders Attacking Coast - The PK has learned that Viking raiders are attacking the coast of a random kingdom (if Logres is indicated, then the raiders have landed in Lincoln). The PK may ride immediately to the indicated kingdom and join in the battle. If the PK delays in leaving for the battle, it will be over and the raiders fled before he reaches the coast. In the battle, the PK faces a randomly drawn Knight, the raiders’ leader. He is not a Knight: he will not fight chivalrously, uses only a sword from horseback, and does not suffer from being shield-less. If the PK is defeated by the raider, he will be robbed of all of his equipment and receive neither CP nor VP. If the PK beats the raiders’ leader, the raiders will flee and the PK will gain 6 VP and CP equal to the leader’s WL. |
| 11 | Special Tournament at Camelot Castle - All PKs are informed of a Special Tournament at Camelot Castle to be held three turns from now (see page 71). Optional Rule: The SPECIAL TOURNAMENT AT CAMELOT can only occur once per game. |
| 12 | Report of the Questing Beast - The Questing Beast is a fabulous creature, with the head of a serpent, the body of a leopard, the hind quarters of a lion, and the feet of a hart; it makes a noise like a multitude of yapping hounds, and is always pursued but never caught. The pursuit of this creature is considered to be a highly virtuous act. The PK has just gained word that the Questing Beast has been sighted in a randomly determined Kingdom. Only the PK receiving the Message may pursue the Beast. If the PK travels by the shortest route to the Beast and finds it (Luck Test), he has sighted it and gains 12 VP. Whether he found it or not, the Beast is then redeployed (rerolling a current Kingdom result) and the PK may pursue it and try to glimpse it again for 6 VP each additional time it is sighted. The PK may continue to pursue the Questing Beast, but once the PK deviates from the quest, the Beast will disappear. |
