## Misfortune Table

| **Roll 1d6** | **Result** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Swamp** The group rides after the hounds and runs smack into a swamp. Each dog has a 1 in 6 chance of being drowned in the bogs. Each rider must make a Luck Test (+1 for Master Horseman) or his horse will get stuck. Stuck horses can be pulled out by more successful mounts or the PCs will have to return to the hunting lodge for help. |
| 2 | **Trap** Someone has set a trap for you. A wire has been tied between two trees across the path. The lead rider must pass a Luck Test in order to spot it in time. Otherwise your horse stumbles and you are thrown taking a STR1 wound roll on the Wound Table. |
| 3 | **Pasture** The dogs lead the group out of the woods and right into a pasture with a nasty bull. Each round, the bull will charge one of the dogs, goring it on a 2 in 6 chance. Make a Luck Test to retrieve the dogs and leave the pasture. If you kill the bull, the Farmer finds out about it and demands that the local Lord hold you accountable for his loss. 2d6 Silver should cover it. |
| 4 | **Ambush** One of your enemies (or your lord’s) has hired a band of 1d3+2 ruffians to attack you. They are armed with Light Crossbows, Hand axes, daggers and wear Padded Armor. In addition, they have four large wolf-hounds who will attack the hunting dogs. Each combat round, roll a d6 for wolf-hound and hunting dog. On a 6 they kill their opponent. If the hunting dogs kill all the wolf-hounds, they will come to your aid. The ruffians flee if reduced to half their number. <br/><br/>**Ruffian** Attack: +3, STR: 1(4), DEF: 1, TOUGH: 2(4), # ATT: 1, Ranged: +1, Ranged Damage: 4 |
| 5 | **Spring Water** A cool drink would be just the thing right now! Roll 1d6 for all that drink from the spring.<br/><br/> 1.**Foul water** Pass a Luck Test or suffer a Light Wound. <br/>2-5. **Normal Water.** <br/>6. **Exceptional Water** Heal a wound level. |
| 6 | **A Challenge** The group arrives in an isolated clearing. In the middle stands the party’s enemy with two henchmen. He challenges the best warrior in the group to a fight. If he is killed, his henchmen run back to the lodge and report that their boss was murdered by the party. When the PCs return, everyone is arrested. Make a Luck Roll. If successful, the Lord doesn’t believe the henchmen and throws them in jail instead. Otherwise, the PCs are thrown in prison. |

## Rewards

The group that brings in the most Great Stags, Stags, and boars will win Renown and Fame. If this is a PC group, they get to make d3 rolls on the Advancement Table and d3 rolls on the Treasure Table. PCs who are in the winning group get a chance to eat with the king/lord and can therefore have an additional chance to impress him if they succeed at a Luck Test. If successfull, they will get a +1 when rolling on the King Reaction Table for this lord.

# The Grand Hunt

On special ocasions there will be a Grand Hunt. Follow the rules above for as many days as you like, but no Grand Hunt should last more than a week (Actually 6 days is the limit because no one will hunt on Sundays).

On the final day of hunting, the party will be able to partake in the Grand Hunt. The King/lord, all his retainers, hunters, guests, etc will gather in the fields by the edge of a forest with a pack of several hundred hunting dogs. The wardens will let loose six enormous wild boars into the forest with a 10 minute head start. Then the chase begins!

Each PC will need to make the following rolls: 4+ to Track, Strength to Ride (with a +2 bonus for Master Horsemen), Luck of the Day and 4+ for Endurance. Add each success to a d6 roll and consult the following table:

| **Total** | **Result** |
| --- | --- |
| 1-2 | **Should've stayed in bed this morning...** The PC is quickly forced to the rear and choked by the rider's dust. As the chase turns suddenly, he falls from his horse and into a mud puddle. Roll a STR 1 wound on the Wound Table. |
| 3-4 | **Risked life and limb, and all I got was this lousy shirt...** Stuck in the rear of the hunting party and squeezed in the middle of a pack of riders resulting in nothing to show for it but dust and bruises. |
| 5 | **Better than Nothing!** The PC, while stuck in the middle of the pack, manages to ride forward briefly to corner one of the wild boars. He and 1d6 other hunters and nearly 2 dozen dogs kill the boar. |
| 6 | **I'll Save You!** As the PC rides to the front of the pack, they see another rider head off down a trail. You follow and see that the rider has tracked down a boar and shot it but only wounded the animal. The boar charges through the pack of dogs wounding the horse causing the rider to fall. It is now up to you to save the day! |
| 7 | **It's just you and me now, pal.** The PC rides toward the front of the pack. Suddenly, the hunting party splits in different directions. Following your own dogs, you discover a boar and must now fight and kill it alone! |
| 8 | **You Bastard!** The PC rides with the leaders of the pack. When the hunting party splits, the PC finds himself in a clearing at close range with a boar… and your enemy! Caught off guard, as the enemy rides by he pushes you off your horse and rides away laughing maniacally. Succeed at a Luck Test to land on your feet or else roll a STR 1 wound on the Wound Table. You must now face a raging boar alone and on foot! |
| 9 | **Serves you Right!** The PC rides with the leaders of the pack. When the hunting party splits, the PC finds himself in a clearing at close range with a boar. But before the boar reacts, your enemy comes bolting into the clearing looking behind and not noticing you. As he rides by you, you can make a Luck Test to unhorse him right in front of the boar! If successful, the boar gets a free round of attacks on your enemy. |
| 10 | **God Save the King!** The PC rides at the very front of the hunting party, right along with the King. After the pack splits up, the PC finds himself and the king alone with a boar. You have 3d6 dogs in addition to your own dogs. Can you protect the king? |

## Results of "God Save the King!"

| Outcome | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Boar Killed, but King wounded | 1 Roll on the Advancement Table and 1 Treasure Roll |
| Boar Killed, but King killed | 1 Roll on the Advancement Table but thrown in Jail |
| Boar Killed, king unwounded | 3 Rolls on the Advancement and Treasure Tables. +1 To Rolls on the King Reaction Table for this king. |
