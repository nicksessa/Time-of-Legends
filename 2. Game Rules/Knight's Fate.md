# Knight's Fate

Whenever a Knight is defeated by another Knight or King in a fight (and some challenges), the defeated Knight is subject to a Knight’s Fate. The defeated player knight rolls one die and adds it to the VL of the victor (or the VL of the King or Lady leading the victor); the resulting number is then looked up on the Knight’s Fate chart. A knight who surrenders to a victor’s terms is honor-bound to observe them.

If the player knight strays from the agreed terms, he loses 2d6 VP. Only certain Knight’s Fates may be refused by player knights: these are marked with an asterisk (\*) after the number on the Knight’s Fate chart. Other Fates may not be refused (meaning 2d6 VP cannot be lost for “disobeying” them). Certain Knight’s Fates have no game effects when chosen for vanquished non player knights; to facilitate matters, those that can be meaningfully chosen for non player knights are marked with a dagger (†).

# Ransom

Ransoming Knights: If you have a castle and you have captured a knight, you may ransom him.  Each turn you can choose to demand a sum of GOLD.  Roll 1D6 and keep adding the total until you have rolled a 1 three times.  If the total exceeds your demand, receive the sum of GOLD you demanded. Otherwise, you must keep the knight.


| dice: 1d6 | Type / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 1 or less † | Slay - The victor slays the loser immediately. A PK may not slay another PK or a King. |
| 2 | Poisoned Wounds - The victor inflicts up to d4 Poisoned Wounds upon the loser. The number given to the loser must not slay him. A PK may choose to give any number of Poisoned Wounds up to a maximum of 4, as long as the restriction is obeyed. |
| 3 † | Imprisons - The victor takes the loser to a nearby Castle and imprisons him there. A PK who wishes to Imprison must own a Castle (Castle Reactions table) and escort the defeated Knight to it. A Castle-owning PK can alternately send the defeated Knight to his Castle as a guard. A defeated PK may not refuse to be imprisoned, but he may refuse to be sent as a guard. |
| 4 † | Declared Enemy - The victor scars the loser for life, and declares him an enemy.  Both characters now Hate each other. Due to the horrible scars, the hero now causes Fear. If enemy Knights meet each other later during the game, their reaction will automatically be to attack and they will fight till one or the other is slain. A PK who defeats another PK may not choose this Fate. |
| 5 * | Exiles - The loser must leave by the most direct means and never return to the Kingdom or Logres castellany in which the combat occurred. If he should return to the area, the knight loses 5 EXP, but may remove the Exile (if he does not have 5 EXP to lose, the Exile remains). If King Arthur assigns this Fate, the Exile concerns all of the Logres castellanies. |
| 6 † | Robs - The victor steals all of the loser’s equipment. A PK may choose to rob in order to replace broken or stolen items or slain horses. (Optional Rule: If the PK initiated the combat and chooses to rob his foe, he forfeits any Virtue Point award) |
| 7 * | Charges with Adventure - The victor sends the loser on a randomly determined Adventure (rerolling any 5:6 TOURNAMENT AT CAMELOT result), which the loser must immediately undertake. Normal awards will be given if successful, but no points will be awarded for failure. If a PK chooses this fate for another PK and the location of the Adventure is random, the PK may choose where the Adventure occurs (except in Faerie or the Road to Rome). |
| 8  † | Will Join - The victor will ride with the loser for a time as a comrade. If the victor is an NPK, his Castle is added to the PK’s list of friendly castles. |
| 9  † * | Demands Company - If the victor is a PK, he may choose this Fate for a losing Knight only if currently pursuing an Adventure; the NPK becomes a Man-at-Arms (if the PK has none) or comrade (otherwise). If the victor is an NPK, the losing PK must accompany him on a randomly determined Adventure (rerolling any 5:6 TOURNAMENT AT CAMELOT result) as a Man-at-Arms. The PK will not receive any awards for the Adventure. The victor is the leader and will thus fight first in each encounter. If he is defeated and the PK proceeds to win the day, he can then leave without any penalty (like a Man-at-Arms), or stay with his victor and share the Adventure normally. |
| 10 * | Sends to Lord - The loser must report to the victor’s Lord. If the victor is an Arthurian Knight, the Lord is King Arthur; otherwise, a Lord must be determined at random. To complete this Fate, the loser must obtain a friendly Castle reaction, but the Castle will not remain friendly after the PK leaves. If the victor is a King, the loser must Escort the King to his royal Castle; the Castle reaction is normal. If assigned at the destination Castle, treat as 5 (Extracts Oath). |
| 11 * | Exacts Oath - The loser must swear one random Oath (Oaths table). If a PK chooses this fate for another PK, he may choose the Oath. |
| 12 † | Free Release - The victor exacts no penalty. |
| 13 | Commends on Skill - The victor admires the skill of the defeated and instructs the loser in combat. The loser gains 1 EXP. |
| 14 * | Sends to Shrine - The victor sends the loser on a pilgrimage to a random Shrine (Shrine table). If a PK chooses this fate for another PK, he may choose the Shrine (but not Rome). |
| 15+ † | Grants Request - In a rare burst of generosity the victor offers to grant any one Request of the loser’s. These include: Join, Give Equipment (if available), Heal, Lift Enchantment, or Arthur’s Favor. A losing NPK will Request to Join the victor as a comrade. |
