# Advancement

  

Completing adventures, defeating adversaries and winning encounters gains the player's party Experience Points (EXP).  Experience Points are awarded to the player's group, not to individual characters.  When the player accumulates at least 10 EXP, he may spend 10 EXP to give one character in his party a chance to level up.  There may be circumstances where multiple characters are given chances to level up.

  

Levels range from 0-10.

  

## Level Up (Advancement)

  
  

| Type of Encounter | Number of Experience Points |
|:-----------------:|:---------------------------:|
| Minion Encounter  |              1              |
|       Boss        |             10              | 
|     Adventure     |           Varies            |

  

**Optional Rule**

Keep track of failed advancement rolls.  After each failed roll, add +1 to the next roll.  For example, say Sir Bors is level 7 and has a chance for advancement and fails the roll.  The next time Sir Bors gets a chance to roll, roll a d10 and add one to the roll.  If he fails again, add an additional +1 to the next roll, and so on.

  

When a character levels up, roll on the appropriate table below.  If the maximum characteristic has been reached, then roll again.  Keep rolling until you get a valid result.

# Base  Stats

Note: It is possible for certain characters to have even lower stats.  For example, INI, ATT, STR, DEF and T could conceivably be as low as 1... or even zero in some rare cases.  For our purposes here, this base stat line will work for most characters.
