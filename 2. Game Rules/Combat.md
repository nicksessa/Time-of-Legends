## Deployment

### The Strategic Roll
**Roll Leadership** - Both sides roll a d6 and add the Discipline score of the model with the highest Discipline on their side.  If any characters have the Leadership ability, add +1 to the roll.  No more than one leader per side counts.  Reroll ties until there is a winner.  The side that won may choose to go first or second.  The side that lost the roll, begins by deploying one model from his side.  After this model is placed, his opponent places a model and so on until all models are deployed.

**Solo Variant** - If the player wins the roll, he may deploy all of his adversaries first, then his models AND he gets to act first.  If the adversaries win, deploy the heroes first, then the adversaries AND they get to act first.

## The Combat Round

### Initiative (Option 1)
After resolving the Surprise Roll, each side rolls a d6.  The side with the highest roll goes first.  This roll is modified by the highest Leadership or Discipline score per side.

### Initiative (Option 2)
Each side rolls a d6 and adds the Initiative value of the character with the highest Initiative value.  Higest modified roll gets to go first.

### Initiative (Option 3) - Card Initiative

Assign miniatures to cards, shuffel, then activate per card drawn.  Add a Wild Card to the deck, and when it comes up, draw from the Wild Card Deck.  (Or roll on the Wild Card Table)

## Melee
Melee as per Confrontation. Attacker rolls 1d6 and adds ATT.  Defender rolls 1d6 and adds DEF.  If the total attack is greater than the total defense, the attack hits and the attacker can roll on the Wound Table.  If the total attack is double or more the total defense, the attacker rolls twice on the Wound Table and take the best result.  If the attacker rolls anything but a one, AND the defender rolls a one on the defense roll, the attacker gets to roll twice on the Wound Table and take the best result of the two rolls.  If the Attacker rolls a one on the attack roll and the Defender does NOT roll a one on defense, the attacker is hit and the defender gets to roll once on the Wound Table.  If both the attacker and defender roll a one, then everyone laughs.

| Situation | Num of Rolls |
|---|---|
| ATT =< DEF | No Roll|
|ATT > DEF | 1 Roll |
|ATT doubles DEF | 2 Rolls|
|ATT roll > 1 AND DEF = 1| 2 Rolls|
|ATT = 1 AND DEF > 1 | Attacker is hit |
|ATT = 1 AND DEF = 1 | Everyone laughs |

## Optional Rule - Melee Combat Events
Roll on the table below when either combatatant rolls a natural 1, either to hit or defend.

| Roll 2d6 | Result |
|---|---|
|2|All of the current Player Character's companions leave. |
|3|Roll a d6. On a 1-3, the PC's shield is broken. |
|4|Roll a d6. On a 1-3, the PC's main weapon is broken. |
|5|The PC's horse is killed. |
|6|Roll a d6.  On a 1-3, the PC is unhorsed. Roll a STR d3 Wound. |
|7|Enemy offers to break off combat. (Some enemies ignore this result)|
|8|Roll a d6.  On a 1-3, the Opponent is unhorsed. Roll a STR d3 Wound. |
|9|Opponent's horse is killed.|
|10|Roll a d6. On a 1-3, the Opponent's main weapon is broken.|
|11|Roll a d6. On a 1-3, the Opponent's shield is broken.|
|12|Reinforcements arrive (A random knight joins the PC)|

Explanation of Events

2. Any Men-at-Arms and Dwarf (unless Arthurian) in the PC’s party leave the scene of combat.  Comrades leave if they fail a Virtue Level Check.  A Mascot stays.

3. If the PC’s shield is broken, the PC may attempt to get a new one from his Dwarf by making a Luck Test.

4. The PC can switch to another available weapon on hand or attempt to get a replacement from his Dwarf by making a Luck Test.

5. If the PC is not fighting on horseback, ignore this result.  Otherwise, the PC is dismounted and will have take a STR 1d3 wound and roll a d6 to see if he’s pinned.  A result of a 1 means he’s pinned under his dead horse.  If pinned, he’s at the mercy of his opponent.  If not pinned, the PC can try to mount his spare horse (if he has one) by passing a Luck Test.

6. If knocked off his horse, roll a STR 1 wound.  The PC can try to remount by passing a Luck Test. 

7. If the PC wishes to stop fighting, have the Opponent make a Virtue Level check.  If this check passes, the fight stops.  Any other remaining hostile Opponents will also stop on a successful Virtue Level check.

8. If knocked off his horse, roll a STR 1d3 wound. He will NOT remount.  If the PC is still on horseback he must choose whether or not to fight chivalrously.

9. If the Opponent was mounted, he must roll a STR 1d3 wound and roll a d6 to see if he’s pinned.  On a 1, he’s pinned and at the mercy of the PC.  Otherwise, he must fight on foot.  If still mounted, the PC must decide to fight at an advantage or to dismount.

10. If the Opponent’s weapon breaks, he can change weapons if one is available.  If an advantage is gained by the PC, he must decide whether or not to fight chivalrously.

11. If the Opponent’s shield is broken, the PC must decide to fight chivalrously or not.

12. A random knight joins to fight for the PC.  He will assist in combat if the PC is defeated.

## Ranged
Characters may use ranged weapons during their turn.  Roll a d6, add modifiers and compare to the target numbers in the table below.  The target number must be met or exceeded in order to score a hit and thereby roll on the Wound Table.  There may be modifiers to this roll.  If you roll double or more the target number, double the strength of the weapon.  For example, if the target number is 5 and you roll (after modifiers) 10 or more to hit, a STR 3 weapon would become STR 6 for this wound roll.

|Range|Target Number|
|:---:|:---:|
|Short|5|
|Medium|7|
|Long|9|

Wound penalties modify this roll.

Moving before or after shooting incurs a -1 penalty to the roll.

Target partially obscured incurs a -1 penalty to the roll.

## Optional Rule - Ranged Combat Events

On the roll of a natural one when rolling to hit, roll a d6.  On a 1, the weapon breaks.  On a roll of a 2, the character runs out of ammunition for that weapon.  On a 3+, nothing special happens.


## Wound Table

When rolling to wound, roll two d6.  The high number is the damage and the low number is the location.  For example, if you roll a 3, 4, this causes a STR 4 hit to the Body.

## Exceptional Wounds

|Roll|Result|Modifier|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1,1|Nothing|No Modifiers|
|2,2|Shock|-1 for one round|
|3,3|Light Wound|-1|
|4,4|Serious Wound|-2|
|5,5|Critical Wound|-3|
|6,6|Killed <br/> (Out of Action for Heroes)|

Penalties are applied to Initiative, Melee Attack/Defense.

All penalties, except for shock, last until healed.

**Optional Rule - Roll for Stun**
If hit in the head, in addition to the usual wound roll, roll on the following chart:

|Roll 1d6|Result|
|:---:|:---:|
|4+|No effect|
|3|Stunned for 1 round|
|2|Stunned for 1d2 rounds|
|1|Stunned for 1d3 rounds|

If wearing an open-faced helm, add +1 to the roll. <br/>
If wearing a fully enclosed helm, add +2 to the roll.

## Breaking From Combat

A character that wishes to break from hand to hand combat will roll a d6 plus Initiative.  The opponent can try to maintain the combat by rolling a d6 plus Initiative.  If the opponent ties or exceeds the character attempting to flee, he is caught and cannot flee.  The character that attempted to flee cannot make any attacks that round.

Alternatively, the opponent can let the character flee and is granted a free attack that must be used immediately against the fleeing character.  The fleeing character does not get to make a defense roll.


## Poisoned Wounds

A Player Character may receive Poisoned Wounds from a variety of sources.  Knight's Fate, Enchantment, etc.  Poisoned wounds do not heal naturally.  They must be healed by a King, Lady, Knight, Priest, prayer to a saint, or a Wood Nymph.

| Roll 1d6 | Result             |
|:--------:| ------------------ |
|    1     | -1 STR             | 
|    2     | -1 TOUGH           |
|    3     | -1 INI             |
|    4     | -1 Melee ATT & DEF |
|    5     | -1 Ranged          |
|    6     | -1 Move *          |

**Note** * The first poisoned wound to Move means to measure front to front when moving instead of front to back.  A second poisoned wound to Move reduces a full range band.  Each poisoned wound to a full range band first reduces movement to front to front.  For example, a poisoned wound to Move on a model with a Medium move, first reduces the movement to Medium -1 which means to use the Medium movement band but measure front to front of the miniature.  A second poisoned wound to the Move score will then drop the move to Short but you can measure front to back.  A third poisoned wound to move, will reduce movement to Short -1 and so on.  The minimum move is 1 inch or the length of the miniature's base.
