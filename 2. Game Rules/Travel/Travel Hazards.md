## Travel Events


# 11 MASSACRE
The Warriors come across a burning wagon in a forest clearing. Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. The Warrior with the highest score recognizes the dying travelers as his blood kin. One of them is able to tell the Warriors who perpetrated the massacre. Roll 1D6:

1 Goblins 4 Dark Elves
2 Skaven 5 Chaos Warriors
3 Orcs 6 Beastmen

From now on, the Warrior whose kin have been slaughtered Hates this type of Monster (see the Psychology section). Note this down on his Adventure Record sheet. Every time he kills one of these Monsters, this Warrior gains an extra 5 gold on top of the Monster's Gold Value.

# 12 FIRE
During the night a fire rages through the camp. The intensity of the blaze is such that it may turn the Warriors' gold to lumps of molten metal. Roll 1D6 for each Warrior and consult the following table:

1 Your Warrior's gold is melted beyond recognition. It is now only worth half its original value.
2-5 Luckily, your Warrior's gold wasn't affected and he is still as wealthy, or as poor, as he was before the fire!
6 Your Warrior's gold is intact! In addition, as he scrabbles in the blackened earth to retrieve his fortune, he finds a long-buried gemstone worth 1D6 x 50 gold.

# 13 CHAPEL
The Warriors see a small chapel. If you wish, your Warrior may spend some time in prayer to his gods. After your Warrior spends 20 gold in offerings you may roll 1D6 on the following table:

1-3 The gods aren't listening, and ignore your Warrior.
4-6 Your Warrior has +1 Wound added to his Starting Wounds. This is 1 permanent addition.
Each Warrior may roll once on this table and then move on.

# 14 QUAKE
The ground opens up in front of the Warriors, creating an impassable chasm many miles long. The Warriors have three choices:

a) Abandon any hope they have of reaching a Settlement, in which case they must go straight into the next adventure.
b) Go back to the caves they just left and start their journey again from scratch taking a different route.
c) Use any length of rope that they have to cross the chasm. If they cross the chasm with a rope, they may not take horses, carts, etc, with them, and must discard the rope once they have safely reached the other side

# 15 STRANGER
The Warriors meet a stranger who asks where they are heading. After being told, he says that he too is going that way, knows a shortcut, and will pay each Warrior 40 gold to let him join them. After all, he explains, there is safety in numbers. The Warriors must let him join them. Roll 1D6 on the following table:

1-3 The stranger does not know the way and the party is soon lost add 1D6 weeks to the length of the journey. He is apologetic, however, and when the Warriors finally arrive, he pays each of them 40 gold as promised.
4-5 The stranger's short cut turns out to be no quicker. Upon reaching civilization, he pays the Warriors 40 gold each.
6 The stranger does know the way well, knocking a week off the Warriors' journey time. Upon arrival at their destination, he gratefully pays each Warrior the 40 gold as promised.

# 16 PEDLAR
The Warriors are stopped by a peddler a strange-looking individual wearing brightly colored rags and carrying a number of wicker baskets in which he keeps his wares. He capers from side to side, playing a piping tune on a reedy flute. The Warriors may buy things from him:

• Healing Potion. 50 gold. Heals 1D6 Wounds. One use.
• Lucky Charm. 50 gold. A Warrior wearing this may re-roll any single dice roll once per adventure.
• Bronze Wristbands. 30 gold. A Warrior wearing these may ignore 1 Wound during any single combat. One use, then they are broken.
• Chalk. 20 gold. A Warrior with chalk may mark an escape route out of the dungeon and therefore needs not roll on the Escape Table (from the Adventure Book) should he wish to leave the dungeon. One use.
• Trinkets. 20 gold. If on the Warriors' travels anyone demands gold from them for any reason they can try and give them these trinkets instead. Roll 1D6. On a score of 1, 2 or 3 they refuse the trinkets and insist on being given the gold. On a score of 4, 5 or 6 they accept the trinkets instead of the gold. Trinkets are only acceptable to fellow travelers, and are never accepted as payment for anything in a Settlement. 

Each Warrior may buy a maximum of one of each item, except trinkets, which he may buy up to six of.

Once the Warriors have made their purchases, the peddler vanishes into the woods. Now roll 1D6 for each object the Warriors have bought. If the result is a 1, that item is shoddily made and is useless. The Warrior has been conned and must discard the item immediately.

# 21 TORNADO
The Warriors are hit by a tornado. The ferocity of the storm rips at the crumbling cliff path, attempting to pluck the Warriors from safety. Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. Look up the lowest number rolled on the following table to determine what happened to the Warrior with that score. If two or more Warriors have the same score, re-roll those dice until the victim of the tornado is determined.

1 The tornado throws your Warrior into a gaping ravine, breaking his legs. He must be carried to safety by the other Warriors, adding one week to the journey time. As soon as the party arrives at its destination, the Warrior must pay 100 gold to be healed. If he cannot afford it, the healer takes all the gold he does have plus one piece of equipment or treasure as payment.
2 Hanging from the ledge by his fingertips, the only way your Warrior manages to stay on is by letting his gold drop into the chasm. Your Warrior loses 5D6 x 10 gold (or all he has, if he has less).
3-6 Your Warrior holds on, but his weapon is plucked from his grasp. Discard any one of your Warrior's weapons.

# 22 UNEVENTFUL WEEK

# 23 PLAGUE
The Warriors arrive at a large town in the grip of the plague and all roads, bar the one the Warriors entered by, are blocked. The Warriors' journey is over, and they must now either go straight onto the next adventure or stop and spend some time in the town.

If the Warriors stay use the normal rules to determine what they do there (see the Settlements section), but each time you make a roll on any table for your Warrior also roll 1D6 on the following table:

1 Your Warrior contracts the plague. He is at -1 Strength for the duration of the next dungeon.
2 Your Warrior contracts the plague. He is at -1 Toughness for the duration of the next dungeon.
3-6 Your Warrior remains unaffected by the plague - for now!

# 24 UNEVENTFUL WEEK

# 25 PRISONER
As the Warriors approach the crest of a hill, they hear the noise of armed men approaching. Taking cover, they watch as a band of swarthy mercenaries troops by, dragging a wealthy-looking man behind them.

The Warriors can either fight the mercenaries and free the prisoner, or let them pass unhindered. If the Warriors attack the mercenaries, roll 1D6 on the following table.

1-2 The mercenaries drive the Warriors off, taking some of their gold.
Each Warrior loses 1D6 x 10 gold.
3-4 The Warriors kill the mercenaries after a long struggle, but not quickly enough to prevent them slaughtering the prisoner. The Warriors each find 1D6 x 20 gold if they search the bodies of the fallen.
5-6 The Warriors best the mercenaries in a fierce fight, and free the prisoner. He cannot travel very fast, and if the Warriors take him with them he adds one week to their journey time. Upon arriving at their destination, he gives each Warrior 100 gold for rescuing him.

# 26 GUESTS
The Warriors arrive in a small hamlet as a local festival is in full swing, and they are invited to stay as guests. They are wined and fed to excess, and have a most enjoyable evening. 
Waking up the next morning, they feel it is only fair to offer payment for the hospitality that the villagers have offered. Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. The Warrior with the lowest score has to pay the villagers (1D6 x 20) gold. If two or more Warriors score equally low, they must roll off until only one player is left to foot the bill!

# 31 WITCH’S CAVE
Deep in a gloomy ravine the Warriors come across the entrance to a dark cave. Inside it dwells a twisted, ugly hag who claims to be a witch.

Each Warrior must pay 1D6 x 10 gold to get a single potion (roll the amount needed to buy each potion separately), and must drink it immediately. Roll 1D6 on the following table:

1-2 Your Warrior falls unconscious, writhing in agony as fire burns through him. When he awakes he feels strangely weak. He is at -1 Toughness for the duration or me next, adventure.
2-4 The potion warms your Warrior to the core. He gains +1 Wound to be added permanently to his Starting Wounds score.
5-6 A powerful heat surges through your Warrior, and he feels energy coursing through his muscles and sinews. He is at +1 Toughness for the duration of the next adventure.

# 32 FAMINE
On the Warriors' travels, they pass through lands cursed by famine and drought. Proving himself the worthy hero that he is, each Warrior gives the poverty stricken peasants a proportion of his gold. Roll 1D6 for each Warrior on the following table:

1-2 Your Warrior gives any one item of treasure to the peasants
3 Your Warrior gives 100 gold to the poor
4-5 Your Warrior gives 1D6 x 10 gold to the poor.
6 Touched by your kindness and concern, the village elder brings a carefully wrapped sword out of his house, presenting it to your Warrior in exchange for 1D6 x 50 gold.

The magical blade is a Sword of Sharpness, and each time it is used it causes +2 Wounds on any Monster it hits. However, the sword can never be sold, as any attempt to get rid of it results in it mysteriously finding its way back to the village. 

If more than one player rolls a 6, draw a Warrior counter to determine whose Warrior gets the sword and roll again for the other Warriors.

# 33 UNEVENTFUL WEEK

# 34 BAD MAP
The Warriors' journey is over, but the Settlement that they were heading for turns out to be wrongly marked on the map, and is little more than a hamlet. The Warriors may stay there anyway and buy equipment, etc., but must roll for item availability as for a village.

# 35 POOL OF DREAMS
The Warriors come across a deep pool of freezing water on top of a mountain. Its surface is like a mirror, with shifting images drifting across its still, icy surface. As the Warriors gaze into the chill waters, they see twisted reflections of themselves, fighting for their lives against the most hideous Monsters. Roll 1D6 on the following table for each Warrior.

1-3 Although he can see these reflections, the Warrior cannot make any sense of them.
4-6 The Warrior realizes that he is being granted a vision of the future! At any time during the next dungeon, he may ignore any one blow that would otherwise hit him. The Warrior recognizes the blow before it hits home as the vision from the pool, and dodges away just in time. Note this on his Adventure Record sheet, crossing it off when he uses it.

# 36 LIGHTNING
As the Warriors are setting up camp on the top of a hill, a storm gathers above them. The sky blackens and grows dim, and thunder rolls. The next instant a lightning bolt streaks from the sky, hitting one of the Warriors on the head.

Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. The Warrior with the lowest score is hit by lightning, melting his armor. He loses two items of armor (a shield and a helmet, for instance). If the Warrior doesn't have two items of armor, the armor he does wear is melted, and the lightning bolt sets his clothes alight too - he arrives in the next Settlement in tattered, charred rags and must therefore buy new robes and new boots.

# 41 LOST
After a few days' travel, the Warriors admit to themselves that they are absolutely lost. They are about to give up the journey completely when they notice smoke curling into the sky a few miles away. A couple of hours later, the Warriors discover the source of the smoke - a small village not marked on their map. Here they are told that the nearest town is another six weeks' travel. The Warriors can either carry on to the town, or end their journey now and see what they can buy here.

# 42 FLOOD
The weather has been bad recently, and the land for miles around has flooded, creating an impassable lake. The Warriors can either abandon any hope they have of reaching their destination, in which case they must go straight into the next adventure, or pay 20 gold each to a ferryman to take them across the obstruction.

# 43 WAYLAID
The Warriors come across a village hit by a storm. The villagers are trying to rebuild their homes, and would greatly appreciate the Warriors' help. The heroic Warriors cannot refuse their pleas, and stay and help them for one week.

# 44 UNEVENTFUL WEEK

# 45 WHICH ROAD?
The road splits into two before the Warriors. One road leads to their chosen destination, but from their map it is impossible to tell which. Do they take the left fork or the right fork?

Once the players have agreed which road the Warriors take, roll 1D6 on the following table:

1-3 The Warriors chose the correct path and may continue on their journey.
4-6 The Warriors took the wrong route and end up at a small village, finishing their journey prematurely.

# 46 AMBUSH
As the Warriors travel through a particularly dark grade in a gloomy forest, they are ambushed by Forest Goblins riding Giant Spiders. Leaping from the shadows, they threaten to overwhelm the hardy Warriors by sheer weight of numbers. Roll 1D6 for each Warrior on the following table:

1 Knocked out by a sneaky blow from behind, your Warrior awakes to find one of his weapons (determine randomly) and 2D6 x 100 gold stolen. 
2 Knocked out by a sneaky blow from behind, your Warrior awakes to find 2D6 x 100 pieces of his gold stolen.
3 Knocked out by a sneaky blow from behind, your Warrior awakes to find one item of equipment stolen (determine randomly
4 Fighting a glorious battle, your Warrior kills many Forest Goblins and gains 1D6 x 10 gold.
5 Fighting a glorious battle, your Warrior kills many Forest Goblins and gains 1D6 x 50 gold.
6 Fighting a glorious battle, your Warrior kills many Forest Goblins and gains 1D6 x 100 gold.

# 51 UNEVENTFUL WEEK

# 52 BLIZZARD
A blizzard howls across the land, swathing all in white. Unprepared, the Warriors are trapped in a bitterly cold landscape where visibility is reduced to a few yards and movement is almost impossible through the banked drifts of snow. The Warriors abandon all hope of reaching a town or city, and take refuge in the nearest village, cutting their journey short. They may buy equipment there as normal. After the blizzard abates, the Warriors may go straight into the next dungeon.

# 53 DOUBLE BACK
After many days' travel through thick undergrowth, barely able to see the sun, the Warriors emerge into a gloomy clearing. In front of them is a cave entrance into a craggy rock face. After a moment's study, they recognize it as the very exit by which they left the dungeon! The Warriors have managed to work their way back to where they started and must now set off afresh!

# 54 ROCKFALL
As the Warriors trek through a dark ravine, there is a dull rumbling above them. A few seconds later a shower of rocks and boulders comes crashing down, blocking their route completely. Although they can still complete their journey without losing any time, they must employ local laborers to clear a path, costing each Warrior 1D6 x 20 gold.

# 55 WAGON TRAIN
The lead wagon of a convoy pulls up alongside the Warriors. The driver says that he is heading for the same destination as they are, and if each Warrior pays him 1D6 x 10 gold they can hitch a lift, saving them one week's travelling time.

# 56 UNEVENTFUL WEEK

# 61 MILITIA
The Warriors see smoke curling above the trees, and within a few minutes reach the crest of a hill overlooking a small Settlement. As they get closer, a group of armed men on horseback approach. They are the town militia and are very wary of strangers. They refuse to let the Warriors stay at the Settlement, hut for a payment of 30 gold each will allow them to pass through it. If the Warriors refuse to pay, they must go around the village and the surrounding fields, adding one week to their journey.

# 62 BRIGANDS
As the Warriors reach the outskirts of a small Settlement, they are set upon by brigands demanding gold. They outnumber the Warriors, but seem wary of their superior arms and armor. The Warriors have a choice: they can either pay the brigands or fight them.

If the Warriors decide to pay the brigands, each Warrior must give up 1D6 x 20 gold.

If the Warriors fight the brigands, roll 1D6 for each Warrior and add them together. This is the total number of brigands that the Warriors are fighting. Then roll another 1D6 for each Warrior and add them together. This is the total number of brigands that the Warriors manage to kill. If there are any brigands left alive after this, then they overpower the Warriors, steal 1D6 x 50 gold from each of them, and disappear into the shadows.

# 63 TRAVELLING MINSTREL
A travelling minstrel joins the Warriors for the rest of their journey. When they reach the gates of the Settlement they are travelling to, he begins to play and sing, convinced that he will earn them all free entry to the Settlement. Roll 1D6 on the following table when the Warriors reach their destination: immediately. Roll 1D6 on the following table:

1 The minstrel's playing is awful, and the Warriors are forbidden to enter the Settlement. They must go straight into the next adventure.
2-5 No one is particularly impressed, but a few inhabitants give the minstrel some gold. The Warriors meanwhile, are free to enter the Settlement as usual 6 The minstrel's song is so rousing that the inhabitants of the Settlement shower gold upon you. Each Warrior gains 1D6 x 10 gold.

# 64 FALL
Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. The Warrior with the lowest score trips over a log and breaks his ankle. How embarrassing! Dragging him along slows the party down, adding two weeks to the journey. When the Warriors reach a Settlement, it costs the injured Warrior 30 gold to have his ankle healed.

# 65 GLORIOUS WEATHER
The sun shines over fields of golden wheat, and all is well with the world. Having walked for many miles and many days over bleak and inhospitable realms, the Warriors decide to take it easy and enjoy the scenery, adding one week to their journey.

# 66 STORM
A storm hits the Warriors' camp, blowing away their tents and equipment in a torrential rainstorm. Each Warrior loses one piece of treasure of your choice.
