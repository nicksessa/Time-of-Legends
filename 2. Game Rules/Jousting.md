# Jousting

  
When a joust is declared, two combatants square off and with lances at the ready, charge each other and attempt to knock their opponent off their horse. Death and serious injury are distinct possibilities. Note that this type of joust is similar to but not the same as a tournament joust. For a tournament joust, see Warhammer Quest's: Full Tilt!  [[Full_Tilt.pdf]]

  
## Sequence of the Joust

Both combatants roll their Melee Attack skill. Whoever rolls highest is said to have struck his opponent. The winner of the round rolls on the chart below and the effect is applied to his opponent. If there is a tie, then both combatants hit each other and both roll on the chart below to determine the outcome of this round of the joust:

**Land** The knight has been gifted a small manor on a small area of land in a distant corner of the lord's realm. The knight can send captured NPC knights there to be held in the dungeon awaiting ransom. He can also stock this manor with his retinue.

In addition, at the start of an adventure the knight can send a message asking for a little spending cash. Roll `dice: 1d66%` and receive that much x10 in Silver. However, on any roll of a double, the money was stolen by bandits or otherwise lost in transit.
