## Luck of the Day

The Luck-of-the-Day roll is made only once per turn and should be noted. Any situations requiring a Luck Test during that turn must be made against this number. It will not change during the turn.

To “test the luck”, a second die is rolled. If the number rolled is equal to or greater than the Luck-of-the-Day, then the PK is successful in the attempt.
