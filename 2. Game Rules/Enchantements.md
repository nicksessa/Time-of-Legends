| dice: 2d6 | Type / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Abandon Lady - The PK is forced to abandon the Lady currently served, losing 1d3 VP (1d6 VP if under Summons) and the Service Award. If the PK serves no Lady, treat this result as Seduce. |
| 3 | Abandon Lord - The PK’s Lord must be abandoned, resulting in the loss of 1d3 VP (1d6 VP if under Summons). The Lord and his Castle will no longer be automatically friendly, and the Lord revokes any Castle granted to the PK. The PK will only be given a sword when visiting friendly Castles (his Dwarf gets nothing) until he enters the service of another Lord. If the PK serves no Lord, treat this result as Seduce. |
| 4 | Change into Animal - The PK turns into a randomly drawn Animal, losing all equipment and any companions (Dwarf, Mascot, or Men-at-Arms) and comrades. A captive Mad Knight is loosed and will need recapturing. The PK’s movement allowance will be 2 until the Enchantment is lifted. The PK rolls normally for encounters and reactions, but may avoid them at will (no Luck Test needed). Exception: if another Animal is encountered, it may not be avoided, and its reaction will be to attack the PK. While in Animal form, a PK is not required to fight chivalrously. The PK may talk, and will receive all awards and penalties normally. If defeated in any combat, the PK/Animal will be slain. The PK retains his normal WL, fights as a normal Animal (using 2 dice), does not suffer from being shield-less, and is able to give a Knight’s Fate when defeating a worthy opponent. The PK is barred from Tournaments, however. Once the Enchantment is lifted, the next encounter(s) with an Animal or Dwarf will reunite the PK with his lost Mascot or Arthurian Dwarf, if applicable. |
| 5 | Imprison - The PK is immediately imprisoned in a local Castle. A direct “Appeal to Jailor” may not be made (see Appeal to Jailor table) |
| 6-8 | Seduce - The PK is seduced, loses VP equal to the VL of the Enchantress, and enters into the service of the Enchantress. If the PK is already serving a Lady, the PK will lose 1d3 VP for abandoning her (1d6 VP if under Summons), as well as the Service Award. The Enchantress’s Service Award is gained. Enchantress service is a stronger Enchantment that Prayer cannot lift. If a Druid chooses this reaction, he leads the PK to a cottage in the countryside where a randomly drawn Lady rests. The Druid uses his magic to seduce the PK with the innocent Lady (or not-so-innocent Enchantress). No Lady reaction needs to be rolled. |
| 9 | Poisoned Wound - One Poisoned Wound is received by the PK; this should be noted on his Adventure Journal. |
| 10 | Rob - All of the PK’s equipment (including a Dwarf, if applicable) disappears magically. If the Enchantment is removed, the equipment will reappear around the PK, wherever the PK may be at the time. |
| 11 | Madness - The PK goes mad immediately and must abandon all equipment, companions and comrades (see page 12) |
| 12 | Sleep (1d6 Turns) - The PK falls into an enchanted slumber for 1–6 turns. All companions and comrades will depart, but the PK’s equipment will remain. Encounters will not occur while the PK is asleep. Another PK may lift the enchantment by a successful Prayer at the enchanted PK’s side, but that PK must first find the Enchanted PK (Luck Test). |

## What is an Enchantment?
An Enchantment is a magical spell which may be cast on a PK. Whenever a PK encounters a Lady who is an Enchantress, the Lady will attempt to Enchant the PK. In addition, an Enchantment will be attempted whenever a PK encounters a Druid disguised as a Hermit (see Goodly Hermit Reactions table). Whenever an Enchantment is attempted, the PK may try to resist it.

## Resisting Enchantments
To resist Enchantment, the PK must pass a VL Check against his VL plus the Lady’s Seduction Adjustment. A Druid has an adjustment of +3; Morgan Le Fay has an adjustment of +5. If the roll is failed, a randomly determined Enchantment is placed on the PK. Otherwise, a lone Enchantress will stomp off, frustrated and hostile. If escorted, she will direct her escort to attack (the NPKs roll to resist the Enchantment; if they resist, they’re too befuddled to obey).

## Lifting Enchantments
The PK may Request of a Knight, King, Lady, or Hermit that they lift an Enchantment by Prayer(see page 21). The PK may request of a friendly Hermit his release from an Enchantress’s service. A Wood Nymph will remove all Enchantments on a PK and release him from an Enchantress’s service.
