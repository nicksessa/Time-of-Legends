# Injury Chart

When figures are taken out of action during a skirmish, roll on the following tables depending

The Mordheim permanent injury chart, **used to determine the long-term effects of severe wounds sustained during battles**, is typically resolved using a D66 roll (two six-sided dice, one representing tens and the other units). Results from this roll determine the nature of the permanent injury or outcome for a warrior.

## Permanent Injuries

| Injury                                                   |
