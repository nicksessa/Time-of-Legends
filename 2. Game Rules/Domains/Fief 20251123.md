# Fief Creation

The Fief campaign differs from the regular system presented above in a number of ways. It adds a couple of additional steps to the campaign turn, plus a whole set of roleplaying elements. 

You take the role of a minor noble, in command of a modest fief somewhere in medieval Europe. At your command is a warband of household retainers and peasant levy, ready to serve in the defense of their homeland. Sometimes a noble of higher station will make some demand of you, but you’re left mostly to your own devices. 

Scuffles between fellow nobles are all too common, over all sorts of trivial disputes like grazing rights or family politics. The Fief campaign follows the course of such a conflict, charting the fortunes of your noble house over a number of months. 

Follow the campaign steps as detailed above, except where these rules prompt you to add in an extra step. 

## Terminology  

**Noble:** Your player character or an NPC Lord. They may join any given battle alongside your other forces with a complex weapon, heavy armor and a horse. 

**Force Pool:**  The total number of figures supported by your fief. Not all of them will participate in any given battle. 

**Balance of Power:** A measure of the struggle between two opposed houses. 

**Wealth:** A measure of the resources available to your house. 

**Dissent:**  A measure of social unrest in your territory. 

**Wealth:** An abstract value that allows you to purchase additional items, acquire more troops and suppress revolts. Ultimately it represents the purchasing power of your noble family in hard cash. Having a high wealth score is never a bad thing. Any items of valuable loot obtained in battle or during campaign events can be exchanged for +1 wealth. 

## Campaign Resources  

The Fief Campaign has three key resources; **Balance of Power**, **Wealth** and **Dissent**, all three of which have a significant impact on the campaign as it progresses. 

**Balance of Power** represents the ongoing course of the war. A higher score indicates numerous victories and increasing superiority over your enemies on the battlefield. With a high score, you will undertake more offensive missions and ultimately bring the campaign to a close. A low Balance of Power indicates that the enemy has got the better of you, routing your troops and forcing you back into your own territory. You will fight more defensive missions and run the risk of losing your holdings all together. 

The following table lays out the methods by which Balance of Power is accrued. 
+1 Balance of Power if you completed the objectives of your last mission.   
+1 Balance of Power for killing over half the enemy force in the last mission.   
-1 Balance of Power for failing to complete the objectives of the last mission.   
-1 Balance of Power for losing over half your force in the last mission. 

When calculating the next mission, roll 1d10 on the table below.

| Balance of  Power   | \+3 to +5 | \-2 to +2 | \-3 to -5 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1-5 | Raid | Pitched Battle | Defensive Action |

## Wealth
An abstract value that allows you to purchase additional items, acquire more troops and suppress revolts. Ultimately it represents the purchasing power of your noble family in hard cash. Having a high wealth score is never a bad thing. Any items of valuable loot obtained in battle or during campaign events can be exchanged for +1 wealth.

---

During Step 8 of the campaign turn, you may spend a point of wealth to perform the following actions: 

* Acquire 1d4 levy figures with simple weapons or ranged weapons. 
* Acquire 1 piece of special gear or 1 advanced weapon or 1 complex weapon or 1 set of heavy armour. 
* Reduce dissent by 1. 
* Reduce the recovery time of one figure by 1d6 days. 

## Dissent

**Dissent** is a measure of unhappiness within your borders. A relatively low dissent score might indicate an increase of crime leading to a loss of income, while a high score might lead to an armed revolt. 

The following lays out the methods by which Dissent is accrued. 

* +1 dissent for losing over half your force in the last mission. 
* +1 dissent for each turn spent with a negative balance of power. 
* +1 dissent for each turn spent with a wealth of 3 or less. 
* -1 dissent for killing over half the enemy force in the last mission. 
* -1 dissent for each turn spent with a positive balance of power. 
* -1 dissent for each turn spent with a wealth of 5 or more. 

During Step 9 of each campaign turn, compare your dissent score with the table below.

|Dissent Score | Effect |
|:---:|---|
|0-5|No effect. |
|6-10|-1 Wealth per turn. |
|11-15|-1 Wealth per turn, 1d4 troops desert from your force pool. |
|16-20+|Play a Take and Hold mission as the attacking side against 3d4+1 Levy figures. Any rolls of 4 when generating this force add one retainer figure to the opposing force. If you win, reset your dissent score to 0. If you lose, the campaign is over and another peasant revolt begins. |

## Force Pool 

The Force Pool is an abstraction of the barrack room in your home castle. It details all the figures available to you in any given battle. The size of this pool will be defined during the fief creation in the campaign set-up. 

The passage of time will have an impact on figures held in the pool. Injury times will decrease for any figures inside the Force Pool as time passes during the campaign turn. If a figure is killed in battle, they are removed from the Force Pool. 

A character may select any combination of figures up to his command rating to take into a battle. 

If the Fief’s Force Pool is full, additional figures may not be added. 

## Fief Generator   

This set of tables represents the physical matter of your fief, from the lay of the land to the amount of influence you wield at court. These will have a direct impact on how you manage your holdings during the campaign turn. Roll 1d10 for each table. Alternatively, pick options up to a value of 20 Creation Points (CP)
