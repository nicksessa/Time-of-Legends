# Quest Points
The more noble deeds that a Knight performs, the more favor will be bestowed upon him by the Lady of the Lake. Winning battles, rescuing damsels, and defending villages will earn your Paladin valuable Quest Points that can be used to help him complete the quest. Quest Points can be used to either increase the size of your retinue or to give your Paladin gifts that will further advance his search for the Grail.

You begin the game with 25 Questing Points that you will use to build your starting retinue. Additional points are gained at the end of skirmishes. This system is described in Advancing your Bretonnian Retinue.

# Retinue

## Table 1 - Henchmen

It costs one Experience Point to roll on this table.  The Number column tells you how many of each are available and the Exp Point Cost column tells you how many experience points per each figure costs.  You do not have to purchase all or even any of the figures.  Even if you chose to not spend any additional Exp Points, you must still pay the cost to roll on the table.

For example.  Let's say that you paid one exp to roll on this table.  You roll a 7 which is 1d6 Men-at-Arms.  You roll for the Men-at-Arms and come up with a 3.  This means that 3 are available for you to purchase at one Exp Point each.

^henchmenTable

\* Promotion allows you to turn one of your Bowmen or Men-at-Arms into either a Unit Champion or a Standard Bearer. This roll may be re-rolled for free if no Bowmen or Men-at-Arms have been rolled yet or you already have a Champion and Standard Bearer for each unit.

\*\* Rabble have the same statistics as Men-at-Arms.  Battle pilgrims?  Reliquiae?
