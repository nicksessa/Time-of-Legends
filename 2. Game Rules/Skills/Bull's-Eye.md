Once per combat round a figure with this skill may forego all other attacks and actions to take a special ranged attack. If the Ranged Attack is successful, the difference between the Target Number and the final RANGED Attack roll is added to the STR of the attack. For example, if the target number is 4 and the RANGED attack roll was 6, then +2 would be added to the STR of the attack.
