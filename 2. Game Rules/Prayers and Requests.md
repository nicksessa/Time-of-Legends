## Prayers

A prayer is often necessary to cure Poisoned Wounds, lift Enchantments (but not Enchantress service), cure a Knight of his madness, or even save a dying relative.

Prayer can be attempted once per turn, in the Request phase. Knights (including PKs), Kings, Ladies, and Hermits may pray.  A person’s Prayer is resolved by a Virtue Level Test of the person.  Hermits automatically succeed, as do King Arthur, King Pellam, Lady Elaine, Sir Bors, Sir Galahad, and Sir Percival because of their high Virtue Level.  A PK may not pray for himself.  

A successful Prayer by a PK earns 1d3 Virtue Points (it is considered Aid rendered).

## Prayers to Saints

Praying to saints can provide healing and other benefits, depending upon the saint prayed to.  See [[List of Saints]] and [[Divine Favor]]


## Explanation of Requests

### Adventure
The King, Lady, or Knight (Castle owner) tells the PK of a randomly determined Adventure (see page 63). From the PK’s Lord, reroll a 2:2 VISIT LOCAL KING result, and treat a 6:5 result as SAVE YOUR LADY (reroll if no Lady is served). From the PK’s Lady, reroll a 1:1 COURT LADY or 5:5 TOURNAMENT FOR A LADY result, and treat a 6:5 result as SAVE YOUR LORD. From King Arthur, add 1 to each Adventure die (treat any 7 as a 6); King Arthur also automatically assigns one Arthurian Man-at-Arms to the PK if he had none.

The PK may turn the Adventure down (unless receiving the Adventure from an Enchantress in whose service he is), but doing so will cause his host to become unfriendly (unless it is the PK’s Lord). If the PK turns down an Adventure from his Lady, he is dismissed from her service, losing her Service Award. PKs may not grant this Request.

### Appeal to Jailor
The PK may make one free Appeal to Jailor (see page 48). A PK Castle owner must grant Requests for an Appeal to Jailor (the Luck Test automatically succeeds) and is bound by their outcome.

### Arthur’s Favor
The Arthurian Knight or Castellan (Lord of a castellany) will put in a good word for the PK with King Arthur, so the next time the PK makes a Request of King Arthur, he or she will receive +1 on King Arthur’s reaction. Arthur’s Favor is then consumed (erased from the PK’s Adventure Journal); the PK can obtain it again by repeating the Request. Arthur’s Favor is not cumulative (you may not have more than one such bonus at any given time). Arthurian PKs may not grant this Request.

### Castle
This can only be Requested of the PK’s Lord. The Lord will assign a randomly determined Adventure (reroll a 2:2 VISIT LOCAL KING result, and treat a 6:5 result as SAVE YOUR LADY, rerolling if no Lady is served) which the PK must successfully complete to be granted a Castle. If the Adventure is not completed successfully, the PK’s Lord will assign another Adventure on the return of the PK. Awards for Adventures are gained normally. Once an Adventure is completed, the Lord will grant the PK a Castle within his Kingdom. If a PK ever changes Lords, any Castle granted to the PK by his old Lord will be taken away from him.

### Dwarf
A Dwarf, with a full set of extra Equipment, is given to the PK. The Dwarf will remain with the PK until he is defeated in combat or goes mad. Then the Dwarf will run away, but if he was carrying any equipment, he will leave it behind. Optional Rule: If the PK is defeated but his side wins, the Dwarf leaves only if the PK fails a Luck Test. Arthurian Dwarves are of a hardier stock and will not flee: they will fight if the PK is defeated, and will try to subdue the PK if he goes mad. Should they succeed in the latter case, they will carry him towards the nearest Shrine (or Camelot Castle, if closer) to have him cured of his madness. Arthurian Dwarves fight from horseback (+1) but cannot use a lance.

### Escort
The PK Requests to be allowed to escort the King, Lady, or Hermit. A King is either going back to his royal Castle or on his way to another King's royal Castle or a Shrine (1–2 own royal Castle, 3–4 nearest royal Castle, 5 random Shrine, 6 random royal Castle other than own). A Lady is similarly either going back to her own Castle or to a royal Castle (1–2 own Castle (deploy as needed), 3–4 nearest royal Castle, 5 random Shrine, 6 random royal Castle). A Hermit is always headed for a random Shrine, but since he refuses to ride, the Escort will need to be conducted at a walk (movement allowance of 1). Escorts must take the most direct route but can stop (for no more than one turn at a time) at Castles along the way if necessary (except in the case of an Hermit or Pilgrims). The Escort earns the PK 1 VP per turn of duration (excluding stopovers) and allows Requests to be made along the way.

### Heal
A PK’s Lord or Lady will automatically grant this Request. The Knight, King, or Lady heals one of the PK’s Poisoned Wounds if their prayer succeeds. King Arthur or a Hermit heal all of a PK’s Poisoned Wounds automatically.

### Join
The Dwarf or Knight will join the PK’s party as a companion or comrade, respectively. An encountered Dwarf is not, however, carrying any extra Equipment.

### Lift Enchantment
The Knight, King, Lady, or Hermit completely removes one Enchantment currently on the PK if their prayer succeeds (Hermit prayers are automatically successful).

### Men-at-Arms
The PK is assigned 1–3 randomly drawn Knights as Men-at-Arms. The PK’s Lord (except King Arthur) will always grant the maximum: 3 Knights. King Arthur will give 1–6 Arthurian Men-at-Arms. The Men-at-Arms will stay with the PK until he completes one Adventure (successfully or not), flees an Encounter, goes mad, or is defeated in combat (but only after all combat is over). A PK may not have more than one set of Men-at-Arms in his party at any one time, and may not Request additional Men-at-Arms until those initially acquired are gone. Optional Rule: If the PK is defeated but his side wins, each Man-at-Arms leaves only if the PK fails a Luck Test.

### Pardon
This may only be Requested of the King from whose Kingdom the PK has been exiled. The PK is no longer exiled.

### Pilgrimage
The Hermit grants the PK a Pilgrimage to a randomly determined Shrine (see page 32). The PK must travel to the Shrine by the most direct route. Upon arrival the PK will gain 12 VP; however, if the PK makes any detour, he will lose 12 VP.

### Release from Enchantress’s Service
The Hermit will release the PK from an Enchantress’s service.

### Release from Oath
The Hermit will negate one Oath that the PK has sworn, without penalty to the PK.

### Service: Kings
The PK enters into the service of the new King, whose name is then noted on the PK’s Adventure Journal as the PK’s Lord. The old Lord will no longer be automatically friendly (and will revoke any Castle previously granted to the PK); a normal reaction roll must be made when encountering him. King Arthur has strict requirements for those who desire to serve him and of his Knights themselves (see page 74). If a King declines this Request, it may not be asked again until the PK has been awarded some CP and/or VP.

### Service: Ladies
This can only be Requested if the PK is not already serving a Lady and is alone (no comrades; companions do not count) with the Lady. When Requesting this of a Lady who is friendly only because her Castle is friendly, a Lady reaction must first be rolled; the Luck Test can only be attempted if the Lady remains friendly. The PK enters into the service of the Lady, gaining 6 VP for a successful courtship, and gaining the Service Award in CP from the Lady. The name of the Lady served is then noted on the PK’s Adventure Journal (and the Lady’s Castle placed on the map if not already deployed). A PK may not leave his Lady voluntarily but may lose her to outside influences (see page 12). If a Lady declines this Request, it may not be asked again until the PK has been awarded some CP and/or VP.

### Token
This can only be Requested of the PK’s Lady. She gives her Token to the PK for him to carry into battle. This should be noted on the PK’s Adventure Journal. When a PK carries a Token while attending a Tournament Adventure, that PK gains an extra 6 VP and a bonus of +1 to his combat rolls. The Token is lost if the Lady is lost.

### Welcome
The Castle becomes permanently friendly to one other PK accompanying the PK making the Request (see page 27).




## Aid Requests

| dice: 2d6 | Reaction / Description** |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Rescue from Pursuit - The requesting person is being pursued by a randomly determined local Monster, whom the PK must fight to fulfill the request for Aid. If the PK decides to attempt giving this Aid, the person remains as a comrade and the PK encounters the Monster next turn; if he is victorious, the person aided will be friendly. |
| 3 | Rescue from Prison - An NPK is imprisoned in a local Castle (which could be a royal Castle). The PK may attempt to release him either by storming the Castle or by “Appeal to Jailor” (see Appeal to Jailor table). The attempt need not be successful to qualify as giving Aid. If the attempt is successful, both the person aided and the person released will be friendly. |
| 4 | Rescue from 3 Captors - The requesting person is being detained by three Knights whom the PK must fight. If the PK defeats all three, the person aided will be friendly. |
| 5 | Court a Lady - Approach a local Castle and, after entering, seek the service of the owner, a Lady |
| 6 | Give Shield - The PK is asked to give away a shield (this may be a spare shield). |
| 7 | Give Dwarf - The PK must give away his Dwarf (plus any surplus equipment) to fulfill this request for Aid. |
| 8 | Give Sword - The PK is asked to give away a sword (this may be a spare sword). |
| 9 | Give Horse - The PK is asked to give away a horse (this may be a spare horse). |
| 10 | Escort Home - The PK is asked to escort the encountered person to his or her Home Castle (see Requests table). The royal Castle of a randomly determined Kingdom (or castellany) is the Home Castle for a Knight; a Lady has her own randomly deployed Castle. A King’s Home Castle is the royal Castle of his Kingdom. A Dwarf is a subject of the King in whose area the encounter occurred (roll randomly if in Faerie or the Road to Rome), and his home is that King’s royal Castle. |
| 11 | Deliver a Message - The PK is asked to carry a message to a randomly determined royal Castle. A friendly Castle reaction must be obtained before the message can be delivered (and thus the request for Aid fulfilled). The exact message need not be determined. |
| 12 | Give Directions - This request for Aid is considered to be automatically fulfilled. |

### Giving Aid
A PK may be asked for Aid by an encountered person (King, Lady, Knight, or Dwarf). If the Aid is performed, the PK gains 6 VP; if it is refused, the PK loses 6 VP.

If the request for Aid is impossible to fulfill (for instance, if a sword is requested of a PK who has none), the PK is unable to provide Aid, but will incur no penalty.
