# Divine Favor

Divine Favor is a resource replenished by performing good deeds and religious acts. The amount regained can be modified by having the Religion skill.

Divine Favor is expressed as a number from 0 to 10. You can never have less than zero Divine Favor and 10 is the normal cap. It is possible to increase Divine Favor beyond 10.

**Relics:** Carrying a saint's associated relic can reduce the Divine Favor cost of invoking that saint, though it often requires high Virtue.

**Saint's day:** Invoking a saint on their feast day costs 1 less Divine Favor.
