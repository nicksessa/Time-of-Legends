|:---:|------|
| 2 | Player Knight’s Party Leaves - Any Men-at-Arms and Dwarf (unless Arthurian) in the knight’s party leave the scene of the combat, deserting the knight. Comrades leave if they fail a VL Check. A Mascot stays. |

| 4 | Player Knight’s Weapon Broken - The knight may switch to another available weapon or attempt to get a replacement weapon from his Dwarf (Luck Test). |
| 5 | Player Knight’s Horse Killed - If the knight is on horseback, his horse is killed, and he is unhorsed and reduced to fighting on foot with a melee weapon.  He takes a STR 1d3 Wound from the fall. Otherwise, this result has no effect. The knight may attempt to mount his spare horse, if he possesses one, by making a successful Luck Test. |
| 6 | Player Knight Unhorsed (horse still alive) - Make a [[Horseman (1) - Trained\|Horseman]] check or be unhorsed.  If unhorsed, the knight takes a STR 1d3 Wound from the fall. The knight may attempt to remount (Luck Test). If he fails to remount, he must fight on foot with a sword. |
| 7 | Offer to Break off Combat - If the knight wishes to stop the fighting, the opponent will agree if he passes a VL Check. If the fight stops, award XP and VP as if it had been a challenge. Any remaining hostile knights will also stop on a successful VL Check. No Knight’s Fate may be assigned by either side if this fight stops, even if other fights break out. |
| 8 | Opponent Unhorsed (horse still alive) - Make a [[Horseman (1) - Trained\|Horseman]] check or be unhorsed.  If the opponent is knocked off his horse he takes a STR 1d3 Wound from the fall and he will not remount.  If the knight is still on horseback, he must choose whether or not to fight chivalrously (dismount). |
| 9 | Opponent’s Horse Killed - If the opponent is on horseback, his horse is killed and he must fight on foot with a melee weapon.  He takes a STR 1d3 Wound from the fall. The knight must decide whether or not to fight his disadvantaged foe chivalrously. |
| 10 | Opponent’s Weapon Broken - The opponent will change weapons if he has another (each knight initially has a full set of knightly equipment). If an advantage is gained by the knight, he must choose whether or not to fight chivalrously. |
| 11 | Opponent’s Shield Broken - If the opponent is a knightly foe, his shield is broken.  Should this result give the knight an advantage, he must choose whether or not to fight chivalrously. |
| 12 | Reinforcement Arrives (a random Knight joins the player knight) - A randomly drawn knight arrives. He joins the knight’s party and will assist in combat if the knight is defeated. If the knight has sworn an Oath to always travel alone, the reinforcement may be told to depart after the combat and the knight will not be penalized in any way because of his arrival. |

Explanation of Events

4. The PC can switch to another available weapon on hand or attempt to get a replacement from his Dwarf by making a Luck Test.

5. If the PC is not fighting on horseback, ignore this result.  Otherwise, the PC is dismounted and will have take a STR 1d3 wound and roll a d6 to see if he’s pinned.  A result of a 1 means he’s pinned under his dead horse.  If pinned, he’s at the mercy of his opponent.  If not pinned, the PC can try to mount his spare horse (if he has one) by passing a Luck Test.

6. If knocked off his horse, roll a STR 1 wound.  The PC can try to remount by passing a Luck Test.

|:---------:| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     2     | BLUNDER: As blood and sweat drip across their hand, the Warrior’s weapon slips from grip and clanks into the shadows and out of sight. But before the dropped weapon even hits the floor, the Warrior has already brandished a secondary one and continues the fight! <br/><br/>One of the Warriors who is armed (determined randomly) must drop their primary weapon. They may use any other weapon on their person if applicable or must fight unarmed. Their dropped weapon may be retrieved when there are no Monsters on the Board Section where they lost it. If the Warrior is already unarmed, then re-roll this result. |
|     3     | POWER DRAIN: The Winds of Magic prove unpredictable once again, for the Warrior no longer feels any measurable power emanating from their items! <br/><br/>One Warrior receives no benefits from any magic item that they are carrying, nor may they cast any spells, blessings, or equivalent! At the beginning of the next turn, the item and abilities return to normal. If no Warrior has a Magic Item, can cast spells or similar, then re-roll this result.                                                                                                                                                                |
|     4     | MORE MONSTERS: Just as the Warriors finish contemplating their next move, a horde of Monsters barge into the room to add more confusion and peril! <br/><br/>Roll once on the Monster Table to see who arrives!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|     5     | SUMMON COURAGE: With composure and confidence the Warriors attempt to muster the courage to confront their foes… <br/><br/>Each Warrior may re-roll all failed Fear and Terror tests from this Combat. If the Dungeon-level is 1, then re-roll this result…                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|     6     | MORTAL COMBAT: The combatants are locked in a close-quarter struggle where one false move will allow their enemy to penetrate their defenses! <br/><br/>No models in hand-to-hand Combat may break from Pinning nor change their targets this turn. They must attack the same Monster or same Warrior as they did in the previous turn. If their target(s) was eliminated in the last round, they may ignore this rule and choose any new target. If no model is in hand-to-hand Combat, then re-roll this result.                                                                                                               |
|     7     | MORE MONSTERS: Just as the Warriors finish contemplating their next move, a horde of Monsters barge into the room to add more confusion and peril! <br/><br/>Roll once on the Monster Table to see who arrives!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|     8     | FORTIFY POSITION: With the menacing evil closing in, the Warrior holds his sword tightly, digs his heels into the dungeon floor and braces for an onslaught… <br/><br/>One of the Warriors (determined randomly) may subtract -1 from all Monsters’ To Hit rolls against them this turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|     9     | BREAK: Unable to face the determined Warriors, one of the Monsters breaks from battle and vanishes out of sight! <br/><br/>The Monster with the lowest Gold Value on the Board Section is removed from play. If there is more than one Monster with the lowest Gold Value, then determine the Monster randomly. The Warriors receive no gold for a Monster who breaks. If there is only one Monster on the Board Section, then re-roll this result.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|    10     | MORE MONSTERS: Just as the Warriors finish contemplating their next move, a horde of Monsters barge into the room to add more confusion and peril! <br/><br/>Roll once on the Monster Table to see who arrives!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|    11     | BEAST OF FURY: As one of the Warriors brutally assaults a Monster, it serves only to infuriate the creature!  <br/><br/>The beast roars a death cry that rattles the entire dungeon and the Warriors find it an even more formidable foe, capable of staggering destruction!  This turn, one Monster on the Board Section (determined randomly) causes one extra point of Damage per Dungeon Level each time it hits its target. If there are no Monsters on the Board Section, then randomly choose any Monster on the Board instead.                                                                                           |
| 12          | EVOKE PANIC: The Warriors’ skills are indeed fearsome and the glower on their faces is equally frightening! With gnashed teeth and bulging eyes the Warriors could intimidate even the most gruesome creature!  <br/><br/>One random group of Monsters on the Board Section (i.e. Orcs, Black Orcs, Orc Shaman, Skaven Clanrats, Skaven Wind Globadiers, etc.) is shaken and alarmed by the harsh and violent demeanor of the Warriors and are -1 on their To Hit rolls against the Warriors this turn! If there are no Monsters on the Board Section, then randomly choose any Monster group on the Board instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
