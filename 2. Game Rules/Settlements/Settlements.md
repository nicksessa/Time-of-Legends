# IN THE SETTLEMENT 

The first thing to do when the Warriors arrive at their destination is to nominate one of the players to keep track of how long they stay in the Settlement. The length of the Warriors' stay determines how much they can
achieve, and how much they have to spend to survive. Every day the Warriors spend in a Settlement each Warrior must do all of the following:

1. Each Warrior can undertake a Settlement Activity, which is either:
	1. Visit one trader and attempt to buy and sell one or more items, 
	2. Visit one Special Location, such as the Alchemist's Laboratory, the Wizards' Guild or the Temple, etc.
2. Each Warrior generates a Settlement Event
3. Each Warrior must pay his Living Expenses.

# DETERMINING THE SHOP'S STOCK

Each Equipment Table has a column marked Stock. The number in this column is used to determine whether the item your Warrior wishes to buy is in stock. Each time your Warrior wants to buy something he must roll against the number in the Stock column to see if it is available.

If your Warrior is shopping in a village, you must roll equal to or greater than the number in the Stock column on 1D6 for the item to be available.

If your Warrior is shopping in a town, you must roll equal to or greater than the number in the Stock column on 2D6 for the item to be available.

If your Warrior is in a city, you must roll equal to or greater than the number in the Stock column on 3D6 for the item to be available.

For example, your Warrior is in a town's Armorer trying to buy a Great Shield. The number in the Stock column of the Armorer's Equipment Table for a Great Shield is a 9. You must therefore roll 9 or more on 2D6 (because your Warrior is in a town) for a Great Shield to be available .

# TIMEWASTING

If you roll the Stock dice to see if an item is available , find it is, but then decide your Warrior doesn't want it after all, the trader throws your Warrior out of his shop for wasting his time.

# Finding Special Locations

Villages have no special locations, other than the Ale House.

To see if you can find a particular Special Location in a town you must roll 7 or over on 2D6.

To see if you can find a particular Special Location in a city you must roll 7 or
over on 3D6.

# ALCHEMIST’S LABORATORY

The Alchemist's Laboratory is a very curious place, in which the air is filled with noxious vapors spat from hissing and bubbling vats and jars. Intricately shaped pipes snake between these delicately balanced glass containers, carrying volatile liquids that boil and spit. The sole purpose of this strange array of equipment is to turn base metals into gold - a sight to please any Warrior.

## PAYMENT AND SERVICE

The Alchemist takes any one unused item of equipment or treasure and attempts to turn it into gold. Discard the equipment or treasure card. To determine how much gold the item is turned into, roll as many dice as you
like, add up the scores and multiply the result by 50. However, if any of the dice come up as 1, the transmutation falls and the item fizzles away until nothing is left but a pile of sludge. The Alchemist takes half of the total gold as his fee.

# ALEHOUSE EVENTS

To determine what happens to each Warrior who enters the Alehouse, roll the following number of dice on the Alehouse Events Table.

Barbarian 2D6
Dwarf 2D6
Elf 2D6-4
Wizard 2D6-3

If the total score is less than 2, treat it as a 2.
