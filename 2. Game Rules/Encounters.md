## Countryside and Wasteland Encounters

| Countryside and Wasteland Encounter                       | 
| --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dice: [[Encounters#^CountrysideAndWastelandEncounters]]` |

| dice: 2d6 | Encounter / Description |
| :---: |------|
| 2 | Monster - Take a random monster chit. If a Monster is not avoided (Luck Test), it will always attack immediately, and will slay the PK if victorious. |
| 3 | Mad Knight - A Mad Knight is any Knight (NPK or PK) who has gone mad for some reason. A Mad Knight bears no equipment, but fights unarmed with two attack dice (instead of one for being weaponless) due to the rage of his Madness. If not avoided (Luck Test), a Mad Knight will always attack immediately, and will slay any defeated opponent if victorious in combat. If a PK defeats a Mad Knight (earning half, rounding up, of the Mad Knight’s WL in CPs), he must either slay the Knight (at no penalty), release him to continue his mad wanderings, attempt to cure him by Prayer (see page 21), or carry him, bound and gagged, to the nearest Shrine (or to Camelot Castle if it is an Arthurian Knight; Camelot Castle will be temporarily friendly) where the Knight’s madness will be cured (this lesser act of kindness gains the PK 3 VP). The cured Knight will offer to serve as a Man-at-Arms if the PK has none, or will remain as a comrade otherwise. A bound Mad Knight counts against a PK’s encounter value. |
| 4 | Animal - Take a random animal chit and refer to the Animal Reactions table |
| 5 | Knights (3) - Draw 3 knight cards and refer to the Knight Reactions table |
| 6 | Brigands `dice: 1d6` - Brigands are highwaymen and scoundrels who terrorize travelers and common folk. Only a Knight’s long lance and sharp sword can stand against these villains and make the countryside safe. If a PK does not avoid encountered Brigands, they will always attack immediately. A Brigand has 2 attack dice. If Brigands are victorious in combat, they will rob the PK and his party of all equipment. |
| 7 | Knights `dice: 1d6` - Draw 1d6 knight cards and refer to the Knight Reactions table |
| 8 | Peasants - Peasants are simply a nuisance countryside encounter, stopping the PK’s movement for that turn. They have no rolled reaction and cannot attack or defend; always friendly, they merely get in the way while admiring the PK, telling him of their troubles, etc. |
| 9 | Lady - Draw a lady card and refer to the Lady Reactions table |
| 10 | Goodly Hermit Man | Refer to the Goodly Hermit Man Reactions table |
| 11 | Dwarf - Refer to the Dwarf Reactions table |
| 12 | King - Refer to the King Reactions table |

### Mad Knight

| Name       | Virtue |  I  | ATT | STR | DEF | DR  | AIM | COU | DIS | #A  | Special Abilities |
| ---------- |:------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-----------------:|
| Mad Knight |   0    |  3  |  3  |  3  |  1  |  3  |  0  |  8  |  1  |  2  |  [[Fearless]], [[Feel No Pain]]                 |


### Civilization Modifier
When determining a countryside encounter, the roll is adjusted to reflect the state of civilization within and outside of the Arthurian
realm. Resolve the specific encounter using the appropriate chart.
* In Kingdoms 2–4 (Surluise, Scotland, and Lothian), 1 is subtracted from the roll to reflect the lack of civilization in the northern Kingdoms. A 1 is treated as a 2.
* In Kingdom 7 (Logres), 1 is added to the roll, to reflect the civilized state of Arthur’s Kingdom. A 13 is treated as a 12.
* Countryside encounters in other lands are rolled normally.

### Wasteland Encounters
Wasteland encounters use the Countryside Encounters Chart, subtracting 1 from the die roll to reflect the hazards of the terrain (a net
result of 1 is treated as a 2).

### Wasteland Combat
Neither horses nor lances may be used during combat while in a wasteland. During the turn in which the PK moves out of a wasteland,
he is considered to still be on foot. If the reaction of an encountered person or creature is to attack, a successful Luck Test is required to
remount before combat (this does not apply to an offered challenge, rather than an attack reaction)

## Forest Encounters

| Forest Encounter                          |
| ----------------------------------------- |
| `dice: [[[Encounters#^forestEncounters]]` |


| dice: 2d6 | Encounter / Description** |
|:---------:|---------------------------|
| 2-5 | Monster - Draw a random monster chit. If a Monster is not avoided (Luck Test), it will always attack immediately, and will slay the PK if victorious. |
| 6-7 | Animal - Draw a random animal chit and refer to the Animal Reactions table |
| 8-9 | Lost - The PK has lost his way and is wandering in the Forest. Next turn, roll for an encounter on a 1–3, and if there is no encounter, the PK is no longer lost and may leave the Forest. |
| 10 | Brigands - Brigands are highwaymen and scoundrels who terrorize travelers and common folk. Only a Knight’s long lance and sharp sword can stand against these villains and make the countryside safe. If a PK does not avoid encountered Brigands, they will always attack immediately. A Brigand has 2 attack dice. If Brigands are victorious in combat, they will rob the PK and his party of all equipment. |
| 11 | Mad Knight - A Mad Knight is any Knight (NPK or PK) who has gone mad for some reason. A Mad Knight bears no equipment, but fights unarmed with two attack dice (instead of one for being weaponless) due to the rage of his Madness. If not avoided (Luck Test), a Mad Knight will always attack immediately, and will slay any defeated opponent if victorious in combat. If a PK defeats a Mad Knight (earning half, rounding up, of the Mad Knight’s WL in CPs), he must either slay the Knight (at no penalty), release him to continue his mad wanderings, attempt to cure him by Prayer (see page 21), or carry him, bound and gagged, to the nearest Shrine (or to Camelot Castle if it is an Arthurian Knight; Camelot Castle will be temporarily friendly) where the Knight’s madness will be cured (this lesser act of kindness gains the PK 3 VP). The cured Knight will offer to serve as a Man-at-Arms if the PK has none, or will remain as a comrade otherwise. A bound Mad Knight counts against a PK’s encounter value. |
| 12 | Wood Nymph - The PK has encountered a beautiful Wood Nymph who attempts to distract him. The PK may attempt to avoid her (Luck Test). If he is unsuccessful, he will be distracted for 1–6 turns, but after that time he will be cured of all Poisoned Wounds and released from all Oaths,Enchantments, and Enchantress’s service (including Morgan’s). He will also no longer be lost (if applicable). |
^forestEncounters

(Encounters occur only on a roll of 1 in Forests, regardless of the PK’s party’s size)


## River Encounters

| River Encounter                          | 
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `dice: [[[Encounters#^riverEncounters]]` |


| dice: 2d6 | Encounter / Description |
|:---------:|-------------------------|
| 2-7 | Attacking Knight - Arthurian legends often mention Knights who would wait at rivers for suitable opponents. When a PK encounters this Knight, the latter will attack him. If the PK avoids the encounter (Luck Test) and tries again to cross the river on the next turn, the hostile Knight will still be waiting. The PK must either turn around or spend one turn waiting for the hostile Knight encounter to disappear (though a new encounter roll could result in another Attacking Knight). If the PK loses, he suffers Knight’s Fate. |
| 8 | Animal - Draw a random animal chit and refer to the Animal Reactions table. |
| 9 | Highwayman - The Highwayman is a solitary Brigand (whose WL is determined by an NPK draw) who will “rob” the PK if victorious. He will attack with sword and shield on horseback only (2 Attack Dice + 1 point). The Highwayman is not a Knight: he will not listen to requests to fight chivalrously, and can only be slain, but does suffer from the eventual loss of his shield. |
| 10 | Flooded River - The PK may not cross the River here at this time. The PK must either turn back or spend one turn waiting for the flood to abate. |
| 11 | Troll - The PK has encountered a Troll (WL 8) at the River. The Troll will first attempt to Trick the PK. If the PK escapes the Trick (Luck Test), the Troll will then attack. |
| 12 | Lady Bathing - The PK has just surprised a Lady bathing (reveal her card immediately). It is too late for the PK to avoid this encounter. The Lady is embarrassed and her reaction is rolled at -1 (a reaction of 1 is the same as a reaction of 2). |
^riverEncounters


## Shrine Encounters

Encounters occur only on a roll of 1 in Shrines, regardless of the PK’s party’s size. The encounter is automatically a Goodly Hermit Man who may not be avoided.

A PK may be sent to a Shrine as a Penance, may escort Pilgrims to one, or may choose to travel to a Shrine for meditation. No combat will occur while at a Shrine, nor will the PK’s comrades leave (the PK need not check to retain them while at a Shrine). For each full turn spent in a Shrine, the PK will receive 1 VP.

There are four Shrines on the map. To randomly determine a Shrine, roll a die:

* (Rome: in the lower right-hand corner of the map.)

| Shrine                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- |
| Cantebury in Kent (Magouns castellany, Logres 2). |
| Llanthony: in Wales (8L).                         |
| Carbonek: in Listenoise (10).                     |

| Random Shrine                             |

## Sea Encounters

| Sea Encounter                  |
| ------------------------------------- |
| `dice: [[Encounters#^seaEncounters]]` |


| dice: 2d6 | Encounter / Description |
| :-------: | ----------------------- |
| 2 | Sea Monster - A Sea Monster is an unavoidable Monster encounter. A Monster chit is drawn to determine the type of Sea Monster (Sea Lion, Sea Troll, etc.). As with any Monster, it has three Attack Dice and will slay and devour any defeated opponents if not defeated first. Sea Monsters are usually deadly. A PK defeated by a Sea Monster may try to escape (by Luck Test) but is treated as shipwrecked (below) if successful  |
| 3 | Shipwreck - The PK’s equipment, companions, comrades, and ship are lost in a storm and the PK is washed up on the nearest non-Britain coast, away from Castles, Ports, and Shrines. When this occurs in the North Sea, this is considered to be one of the Wastelands. The PK will first need to move to the countryside before moving to any refuge. Optional Rule: Each equipment, horse, companion, or comrade gets a Luck Test “saving throw”. A lost Mascot will be found again at the next Animal encounter. A lost companion required for the completion of the current Adventure (e.g. a Mad Knight being brought back to his Lord, Adventure 5:3) can be sought in the countryside. |
| 4 | Storm: Move Back - A Storm returns the ship to the area it was in at the start of the turn, which could be back to its Port of departure. |
| 5 | No Wind: Lose 1 Turn - The PK’s ship is becalmed: the PK will lose his next turn. |
| 6-8 | Nothing Happens -  |
| 9 | Good Winds: Extra Move | The PK’s ship makes an extra move without an extra sea encounter roll. |
| 10 | Lady Stowaway - A randomly drawn Lady is revealed and her reaction determined normally. If she calls her champion to defend her, he is disguised as a sailor. Her Homeland should be determined randomly if necessary. |
| 11 | Pirates - Most travelers by ship fear an encounter with these brigands of the sea. Pirates are represented by 10 Brigand chits, and will immediately attack when encountered. If Pirates are victorious in combat, the PK loses his companions and comrades as usual, and the Pirates will rob him of all his equipment, and then land him on the nearest non-Britain coast, away from any Castles, Towns or Shrines. In the North Sea, this is considered to be any one of the Wastelands. As usual when debarking on a coast, the PK will first need to move to the countryside before moving to any refuge |
| 12 | Sea Monster - (see roll result 2) |
^seaEncounters

(Encounters at sea cannot be avoided)


### Combat Aboard Ships

Ships are drawn at random from the appropriate chits. Each Ship counter has a number in the upper left hand corner which represents the WL total of the captain and crew of the ship. The ship’s crew will enter combat once the PK and his party are defeated. The ship’s crew fights as a single individual with 2 attack dice. Knights involved in combat at sea may not use lances or fight on horseback. They may only attack with sword and shield. They do not suffer Combat Events.


## Town Encounters

| Town Encounter                         | 
| -------------------------------------- |
| `dice: [[Encounters#^townEncounters]]` |

| dice: 2d6 | Encounter / Description |
|:---:|------|
| 2 | Plague - The PK catches the Black Death, but his will to live allows him to survive. However, the disease has weakened the PK: he loses 1d3 points from STR. The loss may not be magically cured or restored. |
| 3 | Town Watchman - Six town watchmen find the PK in a tavern and accuse him of riotous behavior and unchivalrous conduct towards women. To convince them of his innocence, the PK must pass a VL Test. If unsuccessful, the watchmen are unconvinced and will attempt to imprison the PK. The PK can submit or resist. If he resists, he loses 3 VP for fighting with the local authorities and combat ensues (defeating a Watchman earns 1d6 EXP but no VP). Draw six Brigand chits to represent the watchmen; unchivalrous foes, they use sword and shield and attack with two dice. Note: The PK cannot use horse and lance in town. If the PK submits or is defeated, he will be imprisoned. |
| 4 | Brigands - `dice: 1d6` - Brigands are highwaymen and scoundrels who terrorize travelers and common folk. Only a Knight’s long lance and sharp sword can stand against these villains and make the countryside safe. If a PK does not avoid encountered Brigands, they will always attack immediately. A Brigand has 2 attack dice. If Brigands are victorious in combat, they will rob the PK and his party of all equipment. |
| 5 | Knights - `dice: 1d6` - Draw 1d6 knight cards and refer to the Knight Reactions table. |
| 6 | Wanton Lady - Draw Lady cards until you find one with a VL of 6 or worse. Her automatic reaction will be to Seduce the PK. The PK may attempt to resist (VL Check) |
| 7 | Beggars - Beggars are simply a nuisance Town encounter, stopping the PK’s movement for that turn. They have no rolled reaction and cannot attack or defend; always friendly, they merely get in the way while telling the PK of their troubles and asking for alms. If you give them `dice: 2d6` CP, then gain `dice: 1d3` Divine Favor |
| 8 | Lady with 3 Knights - Roll a die: `dice: 1d6` on anything but a 1, the three Knights are escorting the Lady and her reaction is determined normally. On a 1, the three Knights are distressing the Lady (redraw until each NPK’s VL is 6 or worse) and she requests Aid from the PK. If the PK defeats the distressing Knights, she will be friendly. |
| 9 | Priest - A Priest is a holy man in the Town. He has the same reactions and abilities as a Goodly Hermit Man (see Goodly Hermit Reactions table), but is more easily encountered. |
| 10 | Children - When Children are encountered in a Town, the PK’s movement stops for that turn, and the next turn is lost amusing the Children with stories of chivalry and virtue. In compensation, the PK receives 3 VP |
| 11 | Dwarf - Refer to the Dwarf Reactions table |
| 12 | King & Knights - Refer to the King reactions table. |
^townEncounters

### Combat in Town
Neither horses nor lances may be used during combat while in a town, except for challenges, which are resolved in the Town’s lists.
