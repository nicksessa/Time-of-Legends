# Warhammer Quest Loot Tables

##### NEW TREASURES FOR WARHAMMER QUEST

### By Christopher Taylor

These charts contain all treasures from the cards for Warhammer Quest, all from the treasure charts in the Roleplay Book, and many from the Warhammer Fantasy Battles books.  The charts are intended to give a comprehensive and expanded spread of treasures without overpowering the game.  In addition, certain treasures such as the bags of gold and scrolls have been removed from the mix and turned into random rolls.  Some of the Objective Room Treasures have been moved as well, such as the stones of Le Marquis, and placed in normal treasure.

As a result, there are many more types of treasure, options, and charts, which makes finding treasure a much more random and unpredictable (and hopefully exciting) event than before.  Some day a system that takes into account the power level of the creatures slain will be finished, but for now this should suffice to make finding treasure a more interesting event.

## MASTER CHARTS

When treasure is found, the actual type discovered must be determined.  In the Roleplay Book there is a small chart before the treasure section that randomized the treasure type, and these Master Charts are an expansion on that concept.  When Treasure is called for, roll on the appropriate table below with the dice shown.  If a Table is called for, then consult that table and roll on it for the treasure discovered.

You have found:
