# Imprisonment
A character may be imprisoned (thrown into a cell within a Castle or Town Jail) by Knight’s Fate, Trick, Enchantment, or by Town Watchmen. An imprisoned character immediately loses all equipment, companions, and comrades.  A player character may make one Appeal per turn.  If imprisoned by an NPC King or Knight, the character may make a direct Appeal to Jailor; if imprisoned by another player character, the player can choose to let the prisoner make a direct Appeal to Jailor; otherwise, the character may only Appeal to a Passerby.  If the passerby agrees to help, and if the terms are satisfactory to the character, the character immediately resolves the Appeal to Jailor.  A character making the same appeal twice in a row is persisting, which allows a reroll when the appeal is ignored.

## Rescuing a Prisoner
A character might pursue an Adventure involving the rescue of an imprisoned person.  Upon arriving at the imprisoning castle, the character may either Appeal to Jailor or Storm the Castle.  To Appeal to Jailor, the character must first resolve a Castle reaction.  If it is friendly, the character may make the Appeal.  To Storm the Castle, the character’s party must defeat 1d6 Knights; if defeated, the character is imprisoned.  Character Castles garrison’s are determined differently (see Castle Reactions table).

## Player Knight Jailors
If a player character is the owner of a Castle, any Knight he defeats (players or non players) may be imprisoned in that Castle or sent to that Castle as a guard.  The Castle owner must abide by the results of any Appeal to Jailor (whether on behalf of a player character or NPC) made by a PC or a passerby. The Jailor loses 1d3 VP per imprisoned player character, every turn.
